However, I would like to do my part to keep the Indie-web alive, and the first part of contributing is to actually write things, so I figure I might as well try to reboot this blog.

So, in order to not lose my bet with @jhthorsen, I will tell you about the last four books I finished. It just so happens they are all scifi, and they are all set in the near future, even if their themes are quite different. <a href=/post/2015-09-30-too-much-scifi-not-enough-mcs/>Read More...</a></section></article></main><nav class=paginator><span class="nav-left faded">&lt; Prev</span>
