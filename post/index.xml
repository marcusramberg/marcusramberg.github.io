I assumed this was related to the black screen between videos, but it turned out this assumption is wrong! I had set the default output to 4K Dolby Vision, and to adjust to content, but that&amp;rsquo;s sub-optimal. There is no need to run all your menus and such in Dolby Vision.</description></item><item><title>Promexplorer</title><link>https://marcus.means.no/post/2023-05-19-promexplorer/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.means.no/post/2023-05-19-promexplorer/</guid><description>Introducing Promexplorer: A Tool for Prometheus Metrics Navigation As software developers, we&amp;rsquo;re constantly inundated with an immense quantity of data and metrics. The influx of information can sometimes be overwhelming, particularly when you need to sift through a multitude of metrics and labels. That&amp;rsquo;s precisely why I developed Promexplorer â€” a tool designed to simplify your interaction with Prometheus exporter feeds.
Simplifying Prometheus Metrics Prometheus is a staple in the open-source community, recognized for its robust metrics collection and alerting system.</description></item><item><title>Manage Hugo With Devenv</title><link>https://marcus.means.no/post/2023-05-18-manage-hugo-with-devenv/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.means.no/post/2023-05-18-manage-hugo-with-devenv/</guid><description>Devenv is a nice tool for maintaining your dev environments, spinning up servers, adding pre-commit-commit hooks and so on. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using a bit for maintaining my nix-config, as well as some work projects, so while reviving my blog from it&amp;rsquo;s slumber, I figured I could use it to improve my setup a bit.
Devenv uses direnv to install required packages when you enter the project, so we can as least use it to install Hugo.</description></item><item><title>Disabling nvim autoformat on a per-repo basis</title><link>https://marcus.means.no/post/2023-05-17-selective-autoformat-lazyvim/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.means.no/post/2023-05-17-selective-autoformat-lazyvim/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m a huge fan of Folke&amp;rsquo;s Neovim distribution lazyvim. It has replaced my own custom lua config, and reduced the time I&amp;rsquo;m spending tweaking my config by a lot.
One nice thing is it enables format on save by default, which is actually what I want for almost all things. However in some repos I contribute to they frown upon this behavior, so I have to constantly remember to turn it off with &amp;lt;space&amp;gt;uf or suffer review comments about excessive white-space fixes :)</description></item><item><title>Enabled comments support with giscus.</title><link>https://marcus.means.no/post/2023-03-20-comments/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.means.no/post/2023-03-20-comments/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve now enabled commments on this site based on giscus.

The official beer event at Delirium was still cancelled, but a bunch of us still gathered there on Friday afternoon. Was great to see old friends from the Open Source community, but I still managed to get to the ULB on Saturday morning in time for my first talk.
Saturday Drawing k8s the right way Not a mind blowing beginning, but some nice suggestions for diagramming Kubernetes clusters, like shaded boxes/color usage, creating things as zones rather than graphs with lines, and to be sparing with the official icon set, as they are very sharp.</description></item><item><title>Also why Iâ€™m always searching for golang</title><link>https://marcus.means.no/post/2022-07-25-also-why-im-always-searching-for-golang-/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Jul 2022 20:33:46 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.means.no/post/2022-07-25-also-why-im-always-searching-for-golang-/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Open source feels</title><link>https://marcus.means.no/post/2022-07-19-open-source-feels/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Jul 2022 14:28:43 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.means.no/post/2022-07-19-open-source-feels/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Latest Arch images install cleanly in UTM</title><link>https://marcus.means.no/post/2022-04-02-latest-arch-images-install-cleanly-in-utm/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.means.no/post/2022-04-02-latest-arch-images-install-cleanly-in-utm/</guid><description>As part of a recent job change, I also acquired a M1 MBP, which is the best one I&amp;rsquo;ve had in the last 20 years. I&amp;rsquo;m also a big fan of Linux and tiling window managers, so I was looking to have an Arch wm on the machine and be able to use i3 and get the best of both worlds.
Initially when I tried aarch64 didn&amp;rsquo;t install cleanly from an ISO, and the arch image UTM provides in their gallery is problematic.</description></item><item><title>Simply deploying to private GKE cluster from Cloud Build</title><link>https://marcus.means.no/post/2022-03-31-simply-deploying-to-private-gke-cluster-from-cloud-build/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.means.no/post/2022-03-31-simply-deploying-to-private-gke-cluster-from-cloud-build/</guid><description>I recently came back to Google&amp;rsquo;s Cloud Platform after some years on other cloud platforms, and as part of my work there I had the requirement to setup a secure GCP cluster for some workloads. Google engineers have provided a nice blueprint for this using a IAP Proxy Bastion host for external access, which works well for safe access from developer machines and allows you to limit Identity Aware Proxy access by GCP Security Groups.</description></item><item><title>Enabling touchid for sudo</title><link>https://marcus.means.no/post/2022-03-27-enabling-touchid-for-sudo/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Mar 2022 21:31:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.means.no/post/2022-03-27-enabling-touchid-for-sudo/</guid><description>Somehow I missed that this is supported, but it&amp;rsquo;s awesome!
