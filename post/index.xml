One interesting component I&amp;rsquo;ve yet to try is Nomad; a lightweight alternative to Kubernetes for keeping your container workload running.
Cool to see how Cloudflare is using it.</description></item><item><title>beorg - org mode on the go</title><link>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/beorg-org-mode-on-the-go/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/beorg-org-mode-on-the-go/</guid><description>One of the big reasons I finally succumbed to the Evil side was the search for a comprehensive notes and todo system.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been testing many approaches, like Taskwarrior and Workflowy, but org-mode is by far the best I&amp;rsquo;ve found so far.
In 2020 mobile is a critical component for such a system, and thus beorg was an important part of that decision. It&amp;rsquo;s an impressive piece of software, implementing all the important features of org mode like syncing, all aspects of sheduling and repeats , custom todo states and a comprehensive parser.</description></item><item><title>Visual Fill Column Mode</title><link>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/visual-fill-column-mode/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/visual-fill-column-mode/</guid><description>When writing text content, soft wrap is preferable to breaking lines. However, with emacs soft wrap defaults to the line of your window, which could be quite long. This ELPA module allows you to configure the line length to your preference.

However, I would like to do my part to keep the Indie-web alive, and the first part of contributing is to actually write things, so I figure I might as well try to reboot this blog.
Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten way into org mode and doom emacs, so it felt pretty natural to use that as my vehicle for returning to blogging.</description></item><item><title>Lessons from building a 270 racing quad</title><link>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2015-10-31-lessons-from-building-a-270-racing-quad/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2015-10-31-lessons-from-building-a-270-racing-quad/</guid><description>After buying A little toy quad copter this summer, I got very interested in RC flying. My wife would probably say obsessed. :) In particular I&amp;rsquo;m interested in First Person View racing.
This is a hobby where you crash a lot, so I decided to build it from scratch so I would be able to service it. Turns out it is a lot of work! Yesterday I finally reached my goal of flying FPV, and it was glorious.</description></item><item><title>Too much scifi not enough MCs</title><link>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2015-09-30-too-much-scifi-not-enough-mcs/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Sep 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2015-09-30-too-much-scifi-not-enough-mcs/</guid><description>Once again, it&amp;rsquo;s the end of the month, and I did not manage to keep my promise to myself, and write my blog posts earlier than last month. So, in order to not lose my bet with @jhthorsen, I will tell you about the last four books I finished. It just so happens they are all scifi, and they are all set in the near future, even if their themes are quite different.</description></item><item><title>Porting AnsibleModule to Perl.</title><link>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2015-08-31-porting-ansiblemodule-to-perl/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Aug 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2015-08-31-porting-ansiblemodule-to-perl/</guid><description>“All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.” ― George Orwell, Animal Farm Ansible is a great orchestration tool, which I&amp;rsquo;ve used extensively for the last years to build infrastructure, or even to accomplish routine tasks like restarting a group of web servers one by one or patching a bunch of servers for critical security issues.
Ansible is written in Python, but you can write modules in anything that can generate JSON.</description></item><item><title>offline decentralized single sign-on in the browser</title><link>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2015-01-15-desentralized-passwordless-browser-auth/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2015-01-15-desentralized-passwordless-browser-auth/</guid><description>Recently, browsers have just begun to implement web cryptography. This means that browsers are now capable of the same kind of passwordless decentralized authentication schemes we&amp;rsquo;ve had server-side with ssh and tls asymmetric keys for decades.
I think this is super interesting. I wonder if users are going to be able to understand how to use it tho. I do want to try.</description></item><item><title>Fixing the Thinkpad Buttonless Touchpad</title><link>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2015-01-07-thinkpad-touchpad/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2015-01-07-thinkpad-touchpad/</guid><description>The default configuration of the xf86-input-synaptics driver makes the clickpad almost unusable (on the T440s). Clicks/Taps do not register properly, misclicking, no palm detection, no soft buttons where they should be, and so on&amp;hellip; The following configuration can be put in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/99-synaptics.conf As a result the clickpad will react a lot more &amp;lsquo;calm&amp;rsquo; than before and the middle &amp;amp; right click button areas match with the printed ones on top of the clickpad.</description></item><item><title>How GitHub uses GitHub to document GitHub</title><link>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2015-01-06-github-documentation/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2015-01-06-github-documentation/</guid><description>Documentation teams across GitHub can take advantage of the GitHub Flow, Jekyll 2.0, and GitHub Pages to produce high-quality documentation.

We manage IT risk on behalf of the business. Thinking Ops is about servers is like thinking Dev is about code cutting.
If you think devops means eliminating operations, you don&amp;rsquo;t understand development or operations.</description></item><item><title>Testing posts from ios</title><link>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2015-01-05-posting-to-github-pages-from-ios/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2015-01-05-posting-to-github-pages-from-ios/</guid><description>This post is a quick test to see if I can easily post to my blog from Working Copy and Textastic.

This lets us easily do zero downtime releases and create new workers as needed to scale. We&amp;rsquo;ve got roles for haproxy, postgresql, nginx, our app servers and a lot more. One thing we&amp;rsquo;ve been handling manually so far is DNS. We&amp;rsquo;re happy Cloudflare users, and they have one of the best DNS admin tools I&amp;rsquo;ve used, but still I felt like we could do better.</description></item><item><title>Convos 0.8 - Spit and polish</title><link>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2014-09-01-convos-0.8-spit-and-polish/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2014-09-01-convos-0.8-spit-and-polish/</guid><description>This fall we released Convos 0.8, with the latest update 0.83 hitting CPAN today. As we&amp;rsquo;re inching closer to 1.0, we&amp;rsquo;ve been focusing on polishing the user interface, fixing bugs and other rough patches in the user experience. One of the most important improvements in this round is how you switch between conversations.
Previously, when you pressed shift+enter, we shifted focus to the conversation list on the top, to let you tab through your most recent conversations .</description></item><item><title>Mojolicious::Plugin::RenderSteps</title><link>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2014-05-27-mojoliciouspluginrendersteps/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 May 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2014-05-27-mojoliciouspluginrendersteps/</guid><description>This weekend I attended the MojoConf hackathon, which was great fun. I had some interesting talks with the rest of the core team, and I collaborated with Joel Berger on Mojo::PG, an adaptor for the Mojo::IOLoop for Postgres. Joel is almost done with a Pool implementation as well, and we&amp;rsquo;ll probably be on CPAN sometime this week.
I also wrote a simple plugin-helper, which I think greatly simplify working with async controllers in Mojolicious.</description></item><item><title>Improved init.d script for unicorn</title><link>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2014-05-15-better-init.d-script-for-unicorn/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 May 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2014-05-15-better-init.d-script-for-unicorn/</guid><description>I went looking for a init.d script for Unicorn today, and Google seemed to give me various links to this one - It&amp;rsquo;s a nice and simple script, but it has a couple of issues. For one, it&amp;rsquo;s missing the LSB header, and more importantly it is missing status.
This does not make Ansible very happy, as it is using the status to check if the service is running before enforcing state=stopped or state=running.</description></item><item><title>Monit notifications in slack</title><link>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2014-05-15-monit-notifications-in-slack/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 May 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2014-05-15-monit-notifications-in-slack/</guid><description>A quick ruby script that lets you receive monit notifications in Slack when a process is in trouble on your server.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2014-05-12-prose.io/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2014-05-12-prose.io/</guid><description>I still prefer to edit my posts in the command line with vim, but prose.io seems like a really nice alternative for when you need to post to Jekyll on the go, from a web browser.</description></item><item><title>Syncthing</title><link>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2014-05-12-syncthing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2014-05-12-syncthing/</guid><description>Syncthing is an Open Source Dropbox/btsync replacement.
