Me</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>Hey there, the internet is a turbulent place, and since I&#8217;ve moved around quite<br>a few times, I think I forgot to introduce myself the last time I made the<br>move. I am Marcus Ramberg, the writer of this blog, and director of<br>Nordaaker, a small British/Norwegian company currently run out of Oslo,<br>Norway. In addition to being my personal blog, at the time being this blog<br>acts as Nordaaker&#8217;s dynamic english presence. As the other director of<br>Nordaaker, Arne Fismen runs our <a href=http://arne.nordaaker.com/>norwegian presence</a>.</p><p>In one form or another, I&#8217;ve been writing on the internet since around<br>2002, when I set up my first own domain, <a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20021106102053/http://thefeed.no/>thefeed.no</a>.<br>Back then I was running my own <a href=http://www.movabletype.com/>Movabletype</a> installation.<br>Thanks to the glorious <a href=http://web.archive.org/web/>Internet Archive</a> you can see my<br><a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20030207101435/thefeed.no/marcus/>first blog</a> the way it looked about a year after it&#8217;s launch. It is<br>very strange for me to go back and read the thoughts I had so many years<br>ago.</p><p>I was also hosting other blogs on my movabletype installation, including<br><a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20030604224909/thefeed.no/slemmen/>slemmen</a>, who wrote about sysadmin stuff and some college friends like<br><a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20030514183347/thefeed.no/marlboro/archives/2002_12.html>marlboro</a> and <a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20030810191404/thefeed.no/gry/archives/000308.html>gry</a>.</p><p>On the <a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20030529184838/thefeed.no/>front page</a> we had a perl script that aggregated all the blogs,<br>a simple planet if you will.</p><p>Back then, I wrote a lot less about tech than I do now. Looking at the<br>categories, we see that the three biggest ones are Travel[44], Geek[36]<br>and Opinion[26]. Still, even then I was journaling things from the<br><a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20030512092014/thefeed.no/marcus/archives/cat_perl.html>Perl Community</a>. However, checking back around 2005, a few years<br>later, Geek[108] was dominant, With Opinion[49] and Mac[34] as the next<br>ones. Perl is trailing 4. with 27 posts. I also wrote <a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20041209060055/http://thefeed.no/marcus/archives/cat_books.html>18 book reviews</a></p><p>About that time I gave my first <a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20041212151353/thefeed.no/marcus/archives/cat_perl.html>talk about a MVC framework</a>.I was<br>already active in the community, contributing a Mason view to Maypole,<br>my third CPAN module. I had been using Mason at work for a couple of years<br>by then. It was not until I started working for ABC Startsiden that I started<br>using Template Toolkit.</p><p>About then, disaster struck. My server HDD died, losing a lot of images<br>from our image galleries. After that, I lost a lot of the motivation for<br>running thefeed, given the risks. Losing people&#8217;s personal data isn&#8217;t fun.<br>At least I am glad that the blogs are preserved in the internet archive.</p><p>It took a while for me to start writing again after that, but in the period 2006-2009<br>I decided to use hosted solutions, keeping both a <a href=http://thefeed.vox.com/>vox blog</a> and a<br><a href=http://marcusramberg.livejournal.com/>livejournal</a>, before finally moving to this blog installation.<br>I&#8217;m self-hosted again, and the software might vary, but I hope the addresses<br>will last for a long time :)</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2020 Suburban Nerd - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer></body></html>
