22:04 * marcus looks at DBIC cookbook, realizes it has subquery support now. *head explosion* 22:04 since 081, yes :) Even tho most things can be rewritten as joins, this has been one of the few things I've been missing in this excellent ORM. It's still marked as experimental, but I'm totally going to be using it from now on :) Apparently this is how it works: <a href=/post/2009-05-30-just-in-case-im-not-the-only-one-who-missed-this/>Read More...</a></section></article><article class=list-item itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Blog><h2 class=headline itemprop=headline><a href=/post/2009-05-27-awesome-route-graph-with-mojoxroutesasgraph/>Awesome route graph with MojoX::Routes::AsGraph</a></h2><div class=meta><span class=key>published on</span>

Mojolicious uses an routes-based dispatcher, which is nice, but sometimes it's hard to keep track of how everything is routed. Luckily Melo already has an excellent solution for this:
Just check out MojoX::Routes::AsGraph , which can generate these lovely graphs for you. It can even generate Ascii graphs, if you're a hard-core console user (Thanks to vti for telling me about that, as well as showing me this module in the first place :). <a href=/post/2009-05-27-awesome-route-graph-with-mojoxroutesasgraph/>Read More...</a></section></article><article class=list-item itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Blog><h2 class=headline itemprop=headline><a href=/post/2009-05-27-tactical-overview-of-your-varnish-instances/>Tactical overview of your varnish instances</a></h2><div class=meta><span class=key>published on</span>

Simply, it is a tool that lets you monitor a few key stats from one or more varnish boxes in real-time, from the command line, in a top-like screen. It's not the most sophisticated tool, but is handy for seeing a real-time view into how your box(es) are doing without needing to set up graphing, open up a browser, etc. <a href=/post/2009-05-27-tactical-overview-of-your-varnish-instances/>Read More...</a></section></article></main><nav class=paginator><a class=nav-left href=/post/page/34/>&lt; Prev</a>
