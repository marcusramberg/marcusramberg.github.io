<a href=http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/newsroom/press/2011/111209xa.html>HP announced</a>
that they are open sourcing webOS, the mobile OS that they bought from Palm,
inspired by BeOS, which Palm acquired a few years before that. Of course,
these news comes as a consequence of HP canning their hardware platform,
ending their tablet ambitions in a spectacular fire sale where they lost money
on every device sold.</p><p>I've been a fan of the simplicity and elegance of webOS for a while. I even
used BeOS back in it's day. I didn't really like the HP devices tho, and for
me this is the optimal outcome. Provided that HP choses a liberal license,
this means that webOS might actually get some adoption.</p><p>I even believe webOS would make a foundation for a nice Linux based desktop OS
(Something Linux desperately needs), if provisions were made for a usable
keyboard and touch-pad multi-touch gestures. Some of the leading internet
pundits are less optimistic about this move than I am tho. John Gruber of
Daring Fireball
<a href=http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/12/09/hp-webos>writes</a>:</p><blockquote><p>I hope Iâ€™m wrong, but I think this is just the difference between putting
your dog down and letting it free on a distant mountain road.</p></blockquote><p>Matt Gemmell takes it
<a href=http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/mattgemmell/rss2/~3/vOQ7reqFIFU/>even further</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Want to know what happens when you make an operating system open? The same
thing as when you leave your car open: sooner or later, it ends up smelling
like a urinal.</p></blockquote><p>Which I find a rather ridiculous notion. Certainly, a lot of Open Source apps
were made by neck-beards with little or no design skills. However, WebOS is
already very well designed, and even contains a nice style guide for apps.
Just look how nice this Open Source twitter client for WebOS looks (<a href=https://github.com/rmxdave/phnx>phnx</a>):</p><p><a href=https://github.com/rmxdave/phnx><img src=http://marcus.nordaaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/phnx.png alt title=phnx width=650 height=480 class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3625"></a></p><p>The distinguished interface style is already there, with gui widgets for app
developers to use, which makes it more likely that usable and user friendly
apps may be developed by an open source community. From running
<a href=http://iusethis.com>iusethis.com</a>, I've noticed that when there's
already a defined style like on the mac, there's a better chance of getting
well designed open source apps.</p><p>Just look at <a href=http://osx.iusethis.com/hp/quicksilver>QuickSilver</a>,
<a href=http://osx.iusethis.com/hp/cyberduck>Cyberduck</a>,
<a href=http://osx.iusethis.com/hp/transmission>Transmission</a> and even
<a href=http://osx.iusethis.com/hp/adium>Adium</a>, widely used open source
mac apps that are far ahead of their equivalent Linux-based apps. Being open
source doesn't have to mean design by committee. It's not like closed source
is a guarantee of good design either.</p><p>What WebOS does need is improved performance, stability, better apis, and
wider availability. The first things are absolutely things that we bearded
Unix types are quite good at. Obviously Open Sourcing a codebase also means
that professionals from several companies contribute, just look at the kind of
boost this has given to Webkit. While on the subject of WebKit, the fact that
WebOS apps are made using open web technologies is a very good fit for the
open source community as well. Some of us that have been developing for the
IOS platform are secretly yearning for a equally good open platform. Android
is certainly not it.</p><p>Hopefully Open Sourcing with a liberal license will help with the last point
too. I specially see Chinese cell phone producers as likely to pick up this
opportunity, but possibly some of the existing android players as well. I'm
even hoping there might be a distribution available for the iPad, and as I
mentioned earlier, I am hoping to see webOS on prominent Linux distributions
in the near future..</p><p>It's not like this is a big closed source platform that is totally alien to
the Open Source community. webOS already runs on linux, and uses a lot of the
same open source technology we know and love (just check the open source
information in the OS to verify this).</p><p>Hopefully HP will allow the current team to steward the OS forward. In my
ideal world they would move the project to github and keep the contribution
flow through pull requests where the core team is able to maintain a certain
level of control.</p><p>If this happens, I see a bright future ahead for WebOS.</p><script src=https://giscus.app/client.js data-repo=marcusramberg/blog data-repo-id="MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzAwODc0ODA=" data-category=Announcements data-category-id=DIC_kwDOEBk1OM4CVAZX data-mapping=pathname data-strict=0 data-reactions-enabled=1 data-emit-metadata=0 data-input-position=bottom data-theme=transparent_dark data-lang=en crossorigin=anonymous async></script></div></div></div></article><hr><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center"><li><a href=mailto:marcus@means.no><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
