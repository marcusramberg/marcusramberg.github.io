Dan points out the fallacy of having to make too many choices when adopting a new framework. I disagree that that is a deciding factor in Rails or django having more web applications listed on appliedstack than Catalyst.</p><p>I believe the extreme Rails hyping and number of books coming out to be a critical Rails success factor, and Google choosing Django as it's only language for App Engine to be a critical Django one. Having said that, I do believe that having to make all of these choices up front, while learning a new framework, has been harmful to Catalyst adoption. I don't think we need to give up flexibility to fix that problem tho.</p><p>We just need to provide good defaults. I shouldn't have to deal with choosing a template system until I've used TT for a while and decided that it sucks. I shouldn't have to decide what the best way for me to talk the database unless I have some legacy model I need to integrate with. I specially don't need to configure a wealth of Authentication modules unless I'm doing something zany.</p><p>Ranting about this is easy, but I'd like to do something more, so I've created a IRC channel, #catalyst-stacked on irc.perl.org, if you are interested in helping to build a full stack framework on top of Catalyst, come by there and join in on the discussion.</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2020 Suburban Nerd - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer></body></html>
