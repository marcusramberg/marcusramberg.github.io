I plan to<br>do a series on extensions that I've found useful recently. To kick it off,<br>I'll feature a model which gives me a simple and useful admin interface to<br>my DBIx::Class models.</em></p><p>When I first got involved with MVC Web Frameworks like Maypole and Ruby on<br>Rails, a big selling point was the ability to generate CRUD (Create/Read/<br>Update/Delete) interfaces to your data model. Ruby on Rails does this through<br>a mechanism called scaffolding, where it adds a set of actions to your<br>controller. It soon became apparent that these CRUD frameworks did not live<br>up to their promise as a base for creating your own custom actions. Usually,<br>you spend more time customizing these controllers than you would just<br>implementing the features you require.</p><p>However, there is still a good use for these for giving your admins a<br>direct interface to your data model. There has been several iterations of<br>these tools for the Catalyst framework, but with Catalyst::Plugin::AutoCRUD,<br>I've finally found something easy to plug into your existing app, which<br>integrates well with most setups.</p><p><img src=http://marcus.nordaaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/autocrud.png alt=autocrud title=autocrud width=500 height=306 class="size-full wp-image-2942"></p><p>For most apps, all you need to do is plug it into the main application class<br>by adding AutoCRUD to your list of plugins. This will plug a complete CRUD<br>application, including controllers and view and templates into your app.<br>By default it will attach itself at '/autocrud', but you can easily change<br>that in config. Just add this to your config file:</p><pre><plugin ::autocrud>
      basepath admin
</plugin></pre><p>and it will respond to /admin/* instead. Another common requirement is to<br>add authentication for the admin interface. One way to accomplish that is<br>by using Catalyst's auto handler functionality. Add a method like this in<br>your Root controller</p><pre>sub auto :Private {
    my ( $self, $c ) = @_;
    if ($c->action->reverse =~ /^autocrud\//) {
        $c->authenticate({},'users');
    }
    return 1;
}</pre><p>Note that my example is using HTTP Basic auth. The actual authenticate call<br>needs to be customized for your realm.</p><p>AutoCRUD supports multiple DBIC Schemas, and if will automatically provide you<br>with a list to let you pick which one to work with. After that, you choose<br>a Result class, and you have access to an extensive AJAX-enhanched database<br>admin tool. You can search and browse data, as well as edit it and add new<br>rows easily. AutoCRUD also understands your DBIC relationships, so you can<br>easily see data related to the current rows.</p><p>Like it's predecessors, I do not recommend trying to make this tool<br>into a generic 'allweb'-application. However, if you use it for what it is,<br>you can save countless of development hours making trivial admin tools. Since<br>it works again your DBIC Schema, you'll also get the advantage of keeping<br>your business logic in the data model. Things like DBIC timestamps will<br>Just Work.</p><p><em>There still might be some polishing left to do on AutoCRUD, but I already<br>find it a hugely useful tool. You can install it just like you would any other CPAN module using</p><p><code>$ cpan Catalyst::Plugin::AutoCRUD</code></em></p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2020 Suburban Nerd - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer></body></html>
