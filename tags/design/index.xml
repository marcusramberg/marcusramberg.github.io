 >You can start making something in seconds.&lt;br />
 One simple idea is all you need before your brain&lt;br />
 automatically explores problems, solutions, and dreams.&lt;br />
 Turning that idea into something tangible and wonderful is harder.&lt;br />
 You need structure, strategies, people, hard work.&lt;/strong

 The software world is young and we are still figuring out the most basic
 processes of the craft. For instance, we tend to label ourself architects or
 designers, inspired by people who build houses or work in mass production.

 First, and most important, can we do something to make the logo BIGGER and
 more prominent? I’ve done a quick sketch using the circumference of my
 coffee cup as a reference guide (see attached) and I’m sure we all agree
 that the new eagle is much easier to see at about three times the current
 size (I’m not sure what that is in computer picas). Everyone agrees that the
 new eagle logo my daughter drew is GORGEOUS, so I really want those feathers
 to stand out over the “Stool” info scrolling through the eagle’s mouth
 (beak? bill? not important).

 Chris has a interesting analysis of a recent move by Facebook to support
 username urls:
&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
 &lt;p>
 Arrington has a post that claims that "Facebook is getting wise to something
 MySpace has known from the start - users love vanity URLs."
 &lt;/p>
 &lt;p>
 I don’t buy it. In fact, I’m pretty sure that the omission of vanity URLs on
 Facebook is an intentional design decision from the beginning, and one that
 I’ve learned to appreciate over time.

As we continue to build our internet personalities, branding gets more and more important. Wonder if I should add an avatar to the sidebar of this blog?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I tend to switch between a &lt;a href="http://search.cpan.org/~mramberg/">Self portrait&lt;/a> I took while Photographing &lt;a href="http://www.startsiden.no/om">ABC Startsiden&lt;/a> and my &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/marcusramberg">Manga me&lt;/a> (From &lt;a href="http://faceyourmanga.com/">Face your manga&lt;/a>). I feel that both of them work, as the manga one is quite recognizable), but I would love to get a good hand-drawn one, as I feel the manga ones are a bit generic.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
