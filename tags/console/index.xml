I just spent way too much time getting through that swamp. If you don't know what it's all about, you can check out this long play video.
Another launch title is International Karate, which was arguably my first exposure to Versus Fighting Games, a category that have consumed more of my time than any others, with game series like Street Fighter and Tekken.</description></item></channel></rss>
