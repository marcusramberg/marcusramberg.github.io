I am also using devenv to manage my development environments. This also includes the blog. This ensures I can easily build and run the blog locally, and keep up to date with the latest Hugo version, without having to install anything on my host system. Devenv also provides easy integration with pre-commit to allow linting of the markdown files, and CI integration with GitHub Actions.</description></item><item><title>Easily Run LLMs on nixOS</title><link>https://marcus.means.no/post/2024-01-02-easily-run-llms-on-nixos/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.means.no/post/2024-01-02-easily-run-llms-on-nixos/</guid><description>With the recent AI craze, it&amp;rsquo;s fun to play with local models. I like ollama, which lets you easily download and interact with various models. Thanks to this recently merged PR, it&amp;rsquo;s now trivial to run your own ollama service on nixos:
services.ollama.enable = true; Adding this to your host config and rebuilding is all it takes to start the service, and you can then interact with it via the cli or rest interface.</description></item><item><title>First Experiences With Homely Alarm</title><link>https://marcus.means.no/post/2023-11-04-first-experiences-with-homely-alarm/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.means.no/post/2023-11-04-first-experiences-with-homely-alarm/</guid><description>For the last few years, we&amp;rsquo;ve had managed alarm service from Sector Alarm. It&amp;rsquo;s mostly been OK, but the price has been increasing every year, and they never upgrade our components, so when I learned about the offering from Homely, I was intrigued.
Basically you own your own components, and pay a monthly fee for monitoring. The components are mostly Zigbee-based, and there&amp;rsquo;s a home assistant integration to get the status into my home assistant setup, so I decided to give it a go.</description></item><item><title>Fixing Annoying Flashing With YouTube When Using an AppleTV With LG OLED TV</title><link>https://marcus.means.no/post/2023-05-30-fixing-annoying-flashing-with-youtube-when-using-an-appletv-with-lg-oled-tv/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.means.no/post/2023-05-30-fixing-annoying-flashing-with-youtube-when-using-an-appletv-with-lg-oled-tv/</guid><description>So for the longest time I&amp;rsquo;ve been annoyed with black flashing whenever I&amp;rsquo;m watching YouTube videos or shorts on my AppleTV. I assumed this was related to the black screen between videos, but it turned out this assumption is wrong! I had set the default output to 4K Dolby Vision, and to adjust to content, but that&amp;rsquo;s sub-optimal. There is no need to run all your menus and such in Dolby Vision.</description></item><item><title>Promexplorer</title><link>https://marcus.means.no/post/2023-05-19-promexplorer/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.means.no/post/2023-05-19-promexplorer/</guid><description>Introducing Promexplorer: A Tool for Prometheus Metrics Navigation As software developers, we&amp;rsquo;re constantly inundated with an immense quantity of data and metrics. The influx of information can sometimes be overwhelming, particularly when you need to sift through a multitude of metrics and labels. That&amp;rsquo;s precisely why I developed Promexplorer â€” a tool designed to simplify your interaction with Prometheus exporter feeds.
Simplifying Prometheus Metrics Prometheus is a staple in the open-source community, recognized for its robust metrics collection and alerting system.</description></item><item><title>Manage Hugo With Devenv</title><link>https://marcus.means.no/post/2023-05-18-manage-hugo-with-devenv/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.means.no/post/2023-05-18-manage-hugo-with-devenv/</guid><description>Devenv is a nice tool for maintaining your dev environments, spinning up servers, adding pre-commit-commit hooks and so on. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using a bit for maintaining my nix-config, as well as some work projects, so while reviving my blog from it&amp;rsquo;s slumber, I figured I could use it to improve my setup a bit.
Devenv uses direnv to install required packages when you enter the project, so we can as least use it to install Hugo.</description></item><item><title>Conference report FOSDEM 2023</title><link>https://marcus.means.no/post/2023-02-07-fosdem-2023-conference-report/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Feb 2023 14:54:34 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.means.no/post/2023-02-07-fosdem-2023-conference-report/</guid><description>I was really happy to be back in Brussels finally, after some cancelled years due to Covid. The official beer event at Delirium was still cancelled, but a bunch of us still gathered there on Friday afternoon. Was great to see old friends from the Open Source community, but I still managed to get to the ULB on Saturday morning in time for my first talk.
Saturday Drawing k8s the right way Not a mind blowing beginning, but some nice suggestions for diagramming Kubernetes clusters, like shaded boxes/color usage, creating things as zones rather than graphs with lines, and to be sparing with the official icon set, as they are very sharp.</description></item></channel></rss>
