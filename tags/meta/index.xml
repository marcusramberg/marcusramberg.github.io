Devenv uses direnv to install required packages when you enter the project, so we can as least use it to install Hugo.</description></item><item><title>Enabled comments support with giscus.</title><link>https://marcus.means.no/post/2023-03-20-comments/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.means.no/post/2023-03-20-comments/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve now enabled commments on this site based on giscus.

However, I would like to do my part to keep the Indie-web alive, and the first part of contributing is to actually write things, so I figure I might as well try to reboot this blog.
Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten way into org mode and doom emacs, so it felt pretty natural to use that as my vehicle for returning to blogging.</description></item></channel></rss>
