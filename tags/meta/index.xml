&lt;code>pre-commit&lt;/code>-commit hooks and so on. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using a bit for maintaining my
&lt;a href="https://github.com/marcusramberg/nix-config">&lt;code>nix-config&lt;/code>&lt;/a>, as well as some work projects, so while reviving my blog from
it&amp;rsquo;s slumber, I figured I could use it to improve my setup a bit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>Devenv&lt;/code> uses &lt;code>direnv&lt;/code> to install required packages when you enter the project, so we can as least use it to install
&lt;code>Hugo&lt;/code>. Also, a spell checking dictionary could be handy?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Enabled comments support with giscus.</title><link>https://marcus.means.no/post/2023-03-20-comments/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.means.no/post/2023-03-20-comments/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve now enabled comments on this site based on &lt;a href="https://giscus.app/">giscus&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

However, I would like to do my part
to keep the &lt;a href="https://indieweb.org/">Indie-web&lt;/a> alive, and the first part of contributing is to actually write things,
so I figure I might as well try to reboot this blog.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten way into &lt;a href="https://orgmode.org/">org mode&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs">doom emacs&lt;/a>,
so it felt pretty natural to use that as my vehicle for returning to blogging. This blog has been living in Jekyll,
but doom emacs integrates with &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo&lt;/a>, and in general it seems a lot nicer. Migrating over to Hugo
also gives me an excuse to play with GitHub actions, which has been on my list for ever so long.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
