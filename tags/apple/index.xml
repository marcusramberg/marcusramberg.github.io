I&amp;rsquo;m also a big fan of Linux and tiling window managers, so I was looking to have an Arch wm on the machine and be able to use i3 and get the best of both worlds.
Initially when I tried aarch64 didn&amp;rsquo;t install cleanly from an ISO, and the arch image UTM provides in their gallery is problematic.</description></item><item><title>Apple tightening the screws on web service developers</title><link>https://marcus.means.no/post/apple-tightening-the-screws-on-web-service-developers/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.means.no/post/apple-tightening-the-screws-on-web-service-developers/</guid><description>Wow. I&amp;#39;m literally stunned. Apple just doubled down on their rejection of HEY&amp;#39;s ability to provide bug fixes and new features, unless we submit to their outrageous demand of 15-30% of our revenue. Even worse: We&amp;#39;re told that unless we comply, they&amp;#39;ll REMOVE THE APP.
&amp;mdash; DHH (@dhh) June 16, 2020 Apparently the rule is now that you cannot have any app related to a paid web service, unless you allow the user to subscribe through the App Store, and give Apple 30%.</description></item><item><title>The Hunt For The Apple Store Associates Program</title><link>https://marcus.means.no/post/2009-03-06-the-hunt-for-the-apple-store-associates-program/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Mar 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.means.no/post/2009-03-06-the-hunt-for-the-apple-store-associates-program/</guid><description>As you might know, we run a software site for mac users, i use this. The site is free to use, and we finance it through the use of advertisments. Mostly we get advertisments from the Google ads program, as well as indie shareware developers, and occationally promotional programs like macheist.
I figure Apple Products would be a good fit for our users, so I was pleased when a quick Google Search turned up the Apple Store Associates Program.</description></item><item><title>Evil Empire in training</title><link>https://marcus.means.no/post/2009-02-14-evil-empire-in-training/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.means.no/post/2009-02-14-evil-empire-in-training/</guid><description>I think this is a pretty clear example of Apple showing their true color. They are not interested in openness or right or wrong, good or evil. Apple has only one interest, and that is generating more revenue for Apple. In fact, their attitude casts doubts on Google's "Do no evil" policy merely by their close association to Apple.
Clearly, Crackulous put Apple in a difficult position, and this is their attempt at solving it with one great swipe of the DMCA-Axe.</description></item></channel></rss>
