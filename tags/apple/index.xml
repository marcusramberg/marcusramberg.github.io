No matter if you provide links to your site or allow signing up in the app.
I wonder if this would still apply if you provide an open source version of your app, but also a paid service for that same open source app?</description></item><item><title>The Hunt For The Apple Store Associates Program</title><link>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2009-03-06-the-hunt-for-the-apple-store-associates-program/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Mar 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2009-03-06-the-hunt-for-the-apple-store-associates-program/</guid><description>As you might know, we run a software site for mac users, i use this. The site is free to use, and we finance it through the use of advertisments. Mostly we get advertisments from the Google ads program, as well as indie shareware developers, and occationally promotional programs like macheist.
I figure Apple Products would be a good fit for our users, so I was pleased when a quick Google Search turned up the Apple Store Associates Program.</description></item><item><title>Evil Empire in training</title><link>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2009-02-14-evil-empire-in-training/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2009-02-14-evil-empire-in-training/</guid><description>I think this is a pretty clear example of Apple showing their true color. They are not interested in openness or right or wrong, good or evil. Apple has only one interest, and that is generating more revenue for Apple. In fact, their attitude casts doubts on Google's "Do no evil" policy merely by their close association to Apple.
Clearly, Crackulous put Apple in a difficult position, and this is their attempt at solving it with one great swipe of the DMCA-Axe.</description></item></channel></rss>
