I&amp;rsquo;m
also a big fan of Linux and tiling window managers, so I was looking to have an Arch wm on the machine and be able to
use i3 and get the best of both worlds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Initially when I tried aarch64 didn&amp;rsquo;t install cleanly from an ISO, and the arch image UTM provides in their gallery is
problematic. (Text only, and also depends on external boot files so it starts breaking down once you sync it to latest arch).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Apple tightening the screws on web service developers</title><link>https://marcus.means.no/post/apple-tightening-the-screws-on-web-service-developers/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.means.no/post/apple-tightening-the-screws-on-web-service-developers/</guid><description>&lt;p>Apparently the rule is now that you cannot have any app related to a paid web service, unless you allow the user to
subscribe through the App Store, and give Apple 30%. No matter if you provide links to your site or allow signing up
in the app.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wonder if this would still apply if you provide an open source version of your app, but also a paid service for that
same open source app?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Hunt For The Apple Store Associates Program</title><link>https://marcus.means.no/post/2009-03-06-the-hunt-for-the-apple-store-associates-program/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Mar 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.means.no/post/2009-03-06-the-hunt-for-the-apple-store-associates-program/</guid><description>&lt;p>As you might know, we run a software site for mac users, &lt;a href="http://iusethis.com/">i use this&lt;/a>. The site is free to use, and we finance it through the use of advertisement. Mostly we get advertisement from the Google ads program, as well as indie shareware developers, and on occasion promotional programs like &lt;a href="http://macheist.net/">Mac Heist&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I figure Apple Products would be a good fit for our users, so I was pleased when a quick Google Search turned up the &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/storeassociates/">Apple Store Associates Program&lt;/a>. &lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Evil Empire in training</title><link>https://marcus.means.no/post/2009-02-14-evil-empire-in-training/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.means.no/post/2009-02-14-evil-empire-in-training/</guid><description>&lt;p>
 I think this is a pretty clear example of Apple showing their true color. They
 are not interested in openness or right or wrong, good or evil. Apple has only
 one interest, and that is generating more revenue for Apple. In fact, their
 attitude casts doubts on Google's "Do no evil" policy merely by their close
 association to Apple.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
 Clearly,
 &lt;a href="http://i.gizmodo.com/5144751/crackulous-allows-for-app-store-piracy"

 put Apple in a difficult position, and this is their attempt at solving it
 with one great swipe of the DMCA-Axe. If given the opportunity to dominate, I
 believe Apple will do much more evil than Microsoft ever did.
