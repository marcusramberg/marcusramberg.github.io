 Lera Boroditsky's findings about how our language decides how we think about
 things is a captivating read. I think this research supports my notion that we
 will require a common world language to be able to truly communicate as
 equals, and to be able to progress as a peaceful species. She comes with many
 examples on how the differences affect fundamental things in our lives. I did
 not actually know that Russians think of death as a woman, but it explains a
 lot :)
