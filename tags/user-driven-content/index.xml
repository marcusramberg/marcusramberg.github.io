 When you put it all together, the story become clear: an outsider makes one
 edit to add a chunk of information, then insiders make several edits
 tweaking and reformatting it. In addition, insiders rack up thousands of
 edits doing things like changing the name of a category across the entire
 site — the kind of thing only insiders deeply care about. As a result,
 insiders account for the vast majority of the edits. But it’s the outsiders
 who provide nearly all of the content.
