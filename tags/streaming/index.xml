 Want to download that youtube video you saw to your hard drive? Now you can.
 simply add 'pwn' to the hostname in the url.
 &lt;a href="http://pwnyoutube.com">pwnyoutube.com&lt;/a> provides both flv and mpeg4
 downloads (when available from youtube). If you prefer, you can also use a
 bookmarklet. Using this service, I have added a download link to all youtube
 videos on our video bookmarking service
 &lt;a href="http://iwatchthis.com/">iwatchthis&lt;/a>.
&lt;/p>

 I find it interesting that streaming copyrighted material seems more
 acceptable to old media than straight downloads. This seems to stem from some
 deep misunderstanding about it being possible to restrict what you are able to
 do with media while still letting you play it back on your own system. This is
 just as wrong for streaming as it has been for every encryption-based scheme
 they've tried up until now. I'm guessing it won't be long until you get a
 'save from spotify' utility as well.
