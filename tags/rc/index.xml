&lt;p>After buying A little toy quad copter this summer, I got very interested in RC flying. My wife would probably say
obsessed. :) In particular I&amp;rsquo;m interested in First Person View racing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is a hobby where you crash a lot, so I decided to build it from scratch so I would be able to service it. Turns
out it is a lot of work! Yesterday I finally reached my goal of flying FPV, and it was glorious. This post is about
some of the pitfalls I met on the way, so you might avoid them.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
