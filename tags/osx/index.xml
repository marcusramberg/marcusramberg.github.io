 We've just pushed a major update to iusethis, adding several social features
 and updating the commenting system with support for replies. To improve
 performance, we've also added a new caching system, to allow us to cache more
 data for logged-in users.
&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>Find your friends&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>
 Looking up your contacts in GMail is a feature that we've wanted for a long
 time, but we did not want to compromise users by asking for their passwords.
 Now that Google supports OAuth we were able to implement it the way we wanted.
 In order to use it, go to your profile and click the 'more' link on the
 'friends' sidebar:

 Having problems copying example code from POD and getting invalid characters
 in your Perl? Apparently this is a problem with nroff on OS X (According to my
 linux hacking peeps), but the solution is quite simple. Just stuff this in
 your .profile or whatever ;)
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>alias perldoc='perldoc -t'&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
 And your pod is rendered in glorious pure-text, without using weird characters
 for ' and -.
