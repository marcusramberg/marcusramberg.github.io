 >You can start making something in seconds.&lt;br />
 One simple idea is all you need before your brain&lt;br />
 automatically explores problems, solutions, and dreams.&lt;br />
 Turning that idea into something tangible and wonderful is harder.&lt;br />
 You need structure, strategies, people, hard work.&lt;/strong
