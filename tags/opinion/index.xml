 Earlier today,
 &lt;a href="http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/newsroom/press/2011/111209xa.html"
 >HP announced&lt;/a
 >
 that they are open sourcing webOS, the mobile OS that they bought from Palm,
 inspired by BeOS, which Palm acquired a few years before that. Of course,
 these news comes as a consequence of HP canning their hardware platform,
 ending their tablet ambitions in a spectacular fire sale where they lost money
 on every device sold.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
 I've been a fan of the simplicity and elegance of webOS for a while. I even
 used BeOS back in it's day. I didn't really like the HP devices tho, and for
 me this is the optimal outcome. Provided that HP choses a liberal license,
 this means that webOS might actually get some adoption.

 That model works well for Linux. Maybe. I'll presume it does. Git eases the
 pain points expressed by Andrew Morton, the maintainer of the -mm tree, in
 this message entitled "This Just Isn't Working Any More"
 &lt;/p>
 &lt;p>In short, it makes siloing easier.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>

 My immediate reaction to reading his post was to think of the old saying
 ‹‹Guns don't kill people, people kill people››. In fact, my experiences with
 forks so far has been two cases of forking repos on github, and doing a pull
 request to the author when my fixes were fit to be included in the main
 distribution. In both cases the authors included my changes in their versions.
