subscribe through the App Store, and give Apple 30%. No matter if you provide links to your site or allow signing up
in the app.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wonder if this would still apply if you provide an open source version of your app, but also a paid service for that
same open source app?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>RoutineHub</title><link>https://marcus.means.no/post/routinehub/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.means.no/post/routinehub/</guid><description>&lt;p>Looking for more shortcuts for your iOS device? &lt;code>RoutineHub&lt;/code> seems to be the best collection out there.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Post to Hugo from ios with Editorial and Working Copy</title><link>https://marcus.means.no/post/hugo-editorial-workflow/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.means.no/post/hugo-editorial-workflow/</guid><description>&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick workflow to post to a Hugo blog on the go using Editorial and Working Copy.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>beorg - org mode on the go</title><link>https://marcus.means.no/post/beorg-org-mode-on-the-go/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.means.no/post/beorg-org-mode-on-the-go/</guid><description>&lt;p>One of the big reasons I finally succumbed to the &lt;a href="https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil">Evil&lt;/a> side was the search for a
comprehensive notes and todo system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been testing many approaches, like &lt;a href="https://taskwarrior.org/">Task Warrior&lt;/a> and
&lt;a href="https://workflowy.com/">Workflowy&lt;/a>, but &lt;a href="https://orgmode.org/">org-mode&lt;/a> is by far the best I&amp;rsquo;ve found so far.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In 2020 mobile is a critical component for such a system, and thus beorg was an important part of that decision. It&amp;rsquo;s
an impressive piece of software, implementing all the important features of org mode like syncing, all aspects of
scheduling and repeats , custom todo states and a comprehensive parser.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>NoOps is an awful word</title><link>https://marcus.means.no/post/2015-01-06-noops-must-die/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.means.no/post/2015-01-06-noops-must-die/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>What do IT Ops do? We manage IT risk on behalf of the business. Thinking Ops is about servers is like thinking Dev
is about code cutting.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>If you think devops means eliminating operations, you don&amp;rsquo;t understand development &lt;em>or&lt;/em> operations.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Testing posts from ios</title><link>https://marcus.means.no/post/2015-01-05-posting-to-github-pages-from-ios/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.means.no/post/2015-01-05-posting-to-github-pages-from-ios/</guid><description>&lt;p>This post is a quick test to see if I can easily post to my blog from &lt;a href="https://appsto.re/no/xONC1.i">Working Copy&lt;/a> and

Instead, make a viewport div that fills the screen, and animate the offset on that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I hope this helps someone, as I spent 3 hours figuring it out.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Onion browser - TOR on IOS</title><link>https://marcus.means.no/post/2012-04-30-onion-browser-tor-on-ios/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Apr 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.means.no/post/2012-04-30-onion-browser-tor-on-ios/</guid><description>&lt;p>
 The Onion Router is a internet project that aims to anonymize your traffic by
 routing it through a dark-net with various exit points to the Internet.
 Normally you would have to install a browser proxy on your machine to access
 TOR, but now there's a
 &lt;a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/onion-browser/id519296448?mt=8"
 >browser available for the iPad and iPhone&lt;/a
 >.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
 Of course, I had to test it by checking out the
 &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road_(marketplace)">Silk Road&lt;/a>,
 a much publicized "Amazon of illegal drugs" that only exists on the TOR
 network.

 I need to look into this for the iusethis iPhone application. The launch time
 is one thing that annoys me with that app now, and this could be a good way to
 sort that out.
&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Tab bar or no Tab bar?</title><link>https://marcus.means.no/post/2009-07-09-tab-bar-or-no-tab-bar/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jul 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.means.no/post/2009-07-09-tab-bar-or-no-tab-bar/</guid><description>&lt;p>
 Interesting writeup from Justin Williams about the use of Tab Bars in iPhone
 development. One of his big gripes is related to the space the tab-bar uses:
&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
 &lt;p>
 When I made the decision, my thinking was that the application had four
 separate features, so it only made sense to separate them using the tab bar.
 What I found as I got further into the development of the application was
 that the bottom tab bar was incredibly limiting for where to place extra
 controls.

&lt;blockquote>&lt;p>I could read that over and over. It’s like the voice of a robot. The voice of authority.

 Want to implement anti-piracy mechanisms in your new iPhone app? I agree with
 most these recommendations for ways of dealing with this issue. However, I
 think that blocking all jail-broken phones would be a big mistake.
