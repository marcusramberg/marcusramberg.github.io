For instance, Franck Cuny read my description of the Mojo routes graph generator. Then he took it upon himself to write the Catalyst equivalent. That is just so awesome! Frank says "For the moment only private actions are graphed.", hopefully, it can be extended to understand chained actions. I can't wait to test it out on the iusethis code base. Now I can just hand this graph to Arne when he wants to know which template matches which action.</description></item></channel></rss>
