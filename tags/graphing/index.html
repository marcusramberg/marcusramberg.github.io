For instance, Franck Cuny read my description of the Mojo routes graph generator. Then he took it upon himself to write the Catalyst equivalent. That is just so awesome! Frank says "For the moment only private actions are graphed.", hopefully, it can be extended to understand chained actions. I can't wait to test it out on the iusethis code base. Now I can just hand this graph to Arne when he wants to know which template matches which action. <a href=/post/2009-05-31-i-love-lazy-web-catalyst-dispatcher-graphs/>Read More...</a></section></article><article class=list-item itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Blog><h2 class=headline itemprop=headline><a href=/post/2009-05-27-awesome-route-graph-with-mojoxroutesasgraph/>Awesome route graph with MojoX::Routes::AsGraph</a></h2><div class=meta><span class=key>published on</span>

Mojolicious uses an routes-based dispatcher, which is nice, but sometimes it's hard to keep track of how everything is routed. Luckily Melo already has an excellent solution for this:
Just check out MojoX::Routes::AsGraph , which can generate these lovely graphs for you. It can even generate Ascii graphs, if you're a hard-core console user (Thanks to vti for telling me about that, as well as showing me this module in the first place :). <a href=/post/2009-05-27-awesome-route-graph-with-mojoxroutesasgraph/>Read More...</a></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2020 Suburban Nerd - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer></body></html>
