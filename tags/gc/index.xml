 Chromatic just wrote a list of
 &lt;a

 >important features that Perl 5 needs&lt;/a
 >. While I agree with most of the listed ones (and in fact
 &lt;a href="http://marcus.nordaaker.com/moving-to-moose-hackathon-2013/"

 proposal during the recent Hackathon), I found one feature curiously missing.
&lt;/p>
&lt;div>&lt;/div>
&lt;div>
 I mean, JWZ pointed this out in 1998;
 &lt;a href="http://www.jwz.org/doc/gc.html"
 >Perl garbage collection is a bad joke&lt;/a
 >. That was 14 years ago, and the situation is the same. It is trivial to
 create a circular reference and trip it up. Especially when you are doing
 event-driven code where callbacks are common, it is quite easy to close over
 some variable and create a leak. Languages like C#, Ruby and Java has this
 sorted already with variants of mark and sweep-based systems, Python has built
 in cycle detectors in their ref count implementation, and even Objective-C
 manages to detect cycles fairly well with their new compile-time automated
 reference counting.&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/div>
&lt;div>&lt;/div>
&lt;div>&lt;/div>
&lt;div>
 Don't worry so much about adding sugar to the syntax. This is a feature Perl
 really needs.&amp;nbsp;
