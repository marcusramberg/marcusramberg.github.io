 So some European madman got himself a Kindle on the 30. July, and the first
 thing he did with it is pop it open and replace the US-centric mobile card:
&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
 &lt;p>
 I modded the&lt;br />
 Kindle 2 with a&lt;br />
 3G HSPA modem and a&lt;br />
 SIM-card holder for use in&lt;br />
 Europe.
 &lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>
 Apparently It's not tested at all yet, so I'm very interested to see how this
 turns out. He will probably need some software support to get it working.
 Somehow I still think he needs to work around the GPS Amazon use to track the
 location of your device.
