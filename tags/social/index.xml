Arrington has a post that claims that "Facebook is getting wise to something MySpace has known from the start - users love vanity URLs."
I don’t buy it. In fact, I’m pretty sure that the omission of vanity URLs on Facebook is an intentional design decision from the beginning, and one that I’ve learned to appreciate over time.</description></item></channel></rss>
