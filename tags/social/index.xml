 We've just pushed a major update to iusethis, adding several social features
 and updating the commenting system with support for replies. To improve
 performance, we've also added a new caching system, to allow us to cache more

 Arrington has a post that claims that "Facebook is getting wise to something
 MySpace has known from the start - users love vanity URLs."
 &lt;/p>
 &lt;p>
 I don’t buy it. In fact, I’m pretty sure that the omission of vanity URLs on
 Facebook is an intentional design decision from the beginning, and one that
 I’ve learned to appreciate over time.
