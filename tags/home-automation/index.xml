Finished migrating all my devices from Deconz. Much nicer OTA, binding and entity management. Next up ZWave. MQTT all
the things!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How I'm running Home Assistant in docker on NixOS</title><link>https://marcus.means.no/post/2020-07-19-how-i-m-running-home-assistant-in-docker-on-nixos/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.means.no/post/2020-07-19-how-i-m-running-home-assistant-in-docker-on-nixos/</guid><description>&lt;p>For the last few years I&amp;rsquo;ve been into home automation, and since I buy random stuff from different vendors and with
various protocols, I use &lt;a href="https://home-assistant.io/">Home Assistant&lt;/a> to tie it all together. My main home server is a
NixOS box, but for a long while I was running home assistant on my old Arch mac mini, because it was such a chore to
handle dependencies with the NixOS home assistant service.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Home Assistant 0.112 released</title><link>https://marcus.means.no/post/2020-07-01-home-assistant-0.112-released-/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2020 23:10:57 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.means.no/post/2020-07-01-home-assistant-0.112-released-/</guid><description>&lt;p>Always glad to see updates to my home automation system of choice.
Performance improvements to logbook and history are much appreciated. I need to switch to the new z-wave integration soon.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Weekend Project: Z-wave controlled Solenoid valve for watering</title><link>https://marcus.means.no/post/2020-06-21-weekend-project-z-wave-controlled-solenoid-valve-for-watering/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.means.no/post/2020-06-21-weekend-project-z-wave-controlled-solenoid-valve-for-watering/</guid><description>&lt;p>Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve set up a manual micro-drip system for our green house and flowers. I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to do something to
automate watering schedules for our the micro drip system and our lawn and even ordered a solenoid valve from the
internets a while back. It arrived a couple of weeks ago, and with a rainy sunday, I was finally ready to tackle this project.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>

&lt;p>Basically I just combined a z-wave light switch with the solenoid switch, stuffed it into a waterproof box and
connected it to the water hose. I also added some heat shrink with glue to waterproof the solenoid sensor. I took some
leftover connectors I had to attach it to a garden hose connector. Presto:&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
