 >A new year is upon us, and I figured this would be good time to take a look
 at the improvements in the Mojolicious framework in the last year. There has
 been a dazzling number of releases, 122 in fact, including the current
 release, 2.42&lt;/em
 >.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
 Some of the releases were mere bugfix releases, with nothing noteworthy to
 add, but I&amp;#8217;ll try going through the major releases in the last year.
 When this year started, we already had a robust MVC Web framework, and through
 the year you will note that a lot of the work has gone into building a first
 class real time web framework. 2010 ended with 1.0, codename Snow Flake,
 released 26th of december 2010. 1.01 fixed a couple of bugs, and added TLS
 Authentication.
