The official beer event at Delirium was still cancelled, but a bunch of us still
gathered there on Friday afternoon. Was great to see old friends from the Open Source
community, but I still managed to get to the ULB on Saturday morning in time for my first talk.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Not a mind blowing beginning, but some nice suggestions for diagramming Kubernetes clusters,
like shaded boxes/color usage, creating things as zones rather than graphs with lines,
and to be sparing with the official icon set, as they are very sharp. Also a good suggestion,
split up a complicated drawing into two simpler ones.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
