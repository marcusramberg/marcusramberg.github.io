It makes us happy that it's now officially supported by some of our favorite rubyists from Oslo.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>&lt;p>Gitorious now is a project maintained by Shortcut AS, which I co-founded. Shortcut AS now officially supports and develops Gitorious in cooperation with contributors outside Shortcut. Gitorious is, and will continue to be, 100% free software, licensed under the Affero GPL.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Last Ninja on the WII</title><link>https://marcus.means.no/post/2009-02-24-last-ninja-on-the-wii/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.means.no/post/2009-02-24-last-ninja-on-the-wii/</guid><description>&lt;p>Nintendo has started offering C64 titles on the WII, and one of the launch titles are one of my all time favorite games, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Ninja">The Last Ninja&lt;/a>. I just spent way too much time getting through that swamp. If you don't know what it's all about, you can check out this long play video.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Another launch title is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Karate">International Karate&lt;/a>, which was arguably my first exposure to Versus Fighting Games, a category that have consumed more of my time than any others, with game series like Street Fighter and Tekken. I did buy Street Fighter IV when it was released on friday, but it hasn't been able to wrestle my attention away from Tekken V Online. &lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
