I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to do something to automate watering schedules for our the micro drip system and our lawn and even ordered a solenoid valve from the internets a while back. It arrived a couple of weeks ago, and with a rainy sunday, I was finally ready to tackle this project.
Basically I just combined a z-wave light switch with the solenoid switch, stuffed it into a waterproof box and connected it to the water hose.</description></item></channel></rss>
