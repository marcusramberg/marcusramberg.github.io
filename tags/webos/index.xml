 Earlier today,
 &lt;a href="http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/newsroom/press/2011/111209xa.html"
 >HP announced&lt;/a
 >
 that they are open sourcing webOS, the mobile OS that they bought from Palm,
 inspired by BeOS, which Palm acquired a few years before that. Of course,
 these news comes as a consequence of HP canning their hardware platform,
 ending their tablet ambitions in a spectacular fire sale where they lost money
 on every device sold.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
 I've been a fan of the simplicity and elegance of webOS for a while. I even
 used BeOS back in it's day. I didn't really like the HP devices tho, and for
 me this is the optimal outcome. Provided that HP choses a liberal license,
 this means that webOS might actually get some adoption.
