I had some interesting talks with the rest of the core team, and I collaborated with Joel Berger on Mojo::PG, an adaptor for the Mojo::IOLoop for Postgres. Joel is almost done with a Pool implementation as well, and we&rsquo;ll probably be on CPAN sometime this week.
I also wrote a simple plugin-helper, which I think greatly simplify working with async controllers in Mojolicious. <a href=/post/2014-05-27-mojoliciouspluginrendersteps/>Read More...</a></section></article><article class=list-item itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Blog><h2 class=headline itemprop=headline><a href=/post/2012-09-13-perl-needs-modern-garbage-collection/>Perl needs modern garbage collection</a></h2><div class=meta><span class=key>published on</span>

While I agree with most of the listed ones (and in fact contributed to the new p5-mop proposal during the recent Hackathon), I found one feature curiously missing.
I mean, JWZ pointed this out in 1998; Perl garbage collection is a bad joke. That was 14 years ago, and the situation is the same. It is trivial to create a circular reference and trip it up. <a href=/post/2012-09-13-perl-needs-modern-garbage-collection/>Read More...</a></section></article><article class=list-item itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Blog><h2 class=headline itemprop=headline><a href=/post/2012-09-01-moving-to-moose-hackathon-2013/>Moving to Moose Hackathon 2012</a></h2><div class=meta><span class=key>published on</span>
<span class=val><time itemprop=datePublished datetime=2012-09-01>September 01, 2012</time></span></div><section class=summary>This week, my excellent Perl Mongers group Oslo.pm, led by the excellent Salve, has arranged an event we called the Moving to Moose Hackathon 2012. The purpose of this event was to promote the adoption of a MOP (Meta Object Protocol) in Perl development. To this effect, we had two groups, the Perl RDF community, looking to adopt moose in their modules, and Stevan Little and his merry gang of p5-mop developers, looking to create a proposal for a MOP in the Perl core itself, to replace the venerable blessed hash object model. <a href=/post/2012-09-01-moving-to-moose-hackathon-2013/>Read More...</a></section></article></main><nav class=paginator><span class="nav-left faded">&lt; Prev</span>
