I believe that with the current race to improve javascript performance, JS stands a good chance of being the language to use both on the server and the client in the near future. <a href=/post/2009-02-26-whats-next-for-google-chrome/>Read More...</a></section></article></main><nav class=paginator><a class=nav-left href=/tags/javascript/>&lt; Prev</a>
