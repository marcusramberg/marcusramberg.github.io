Went for a quick bike ride near Aker Brygge this morning and tested the iPhone 3GS camera. I'd like a tripod mount so I can film from the bike with it. Will test out with the gorillapod and my flip mino hd.
Update: The first set I published was post-processed using adobe lightroom to give them a mood I like. For reference, I've uploaded the non-postprocessed versions as well</description></item><item><title>Baklia Night Sky</title><link>http://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2009-05-24-baklia-night-sky/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 May 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2009-05-24-baklia-night-sky/</guid><description>Baklia Night Sky by Marcus Ramberg

Robots are just so awesome!

It gives focus to the photos, while providing exactly enough metadata (hint: click the picture to view large version). I've linked up my flickr stream here, to see your own, just change the username in the url.</description></item></channel></rss>
