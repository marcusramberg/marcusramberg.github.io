 So, there has been a lot of noise about the diggbar lately. I think Ted Dziuba
 of Uncov fame says it best:
&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
 &lt;p>
 This move shows that not only is Digg willing to pull some sleazy shit to
 increase their unique visitors, but that they also need to pull this sleazy
 shit, because they need more unique visitors.
 &lt;/p>

 Chris has a interesting analysis of a recent move by Facebook to support
 username urls:
&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
 &lt;p>
 Arrington has a post that claims that "Facebook is getting wise to something
 MySpace has known from the start - users love vanity URLs."
 &lt;/p>
 &lt;p>
 I don’t buy it. In fact, I’m pretty sure that the omission of vanity URLs on
 Facebook is an intentional design decision from the beginning, and one that
 I’ve learned to appreciate over time.

The site is free to use, and we finance it through the use of advertisement. Mostly we get advertisement from the Google ads program, as well as indie shareware developers, and on occasion promotional programs like &lt;a href="http://macheist.net/">Mac Heist&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I figure Apple Products would be a good fit for our users, so I was pleased when a quick Google Search turned up the &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/storeassociates/">Apple Store Associates Program&lt;/a>. &lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Big oops for Spotify?</title><link>https://marcus.means.no/post/2009-03-04-big-oops-for-spotify/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Mar 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.means.no/post/2009-03-04-big-oops-for-spotify/</guid><description>&lt;p>I just received a mail from Spotify about a security issue:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
 &lt;p>
 Along with passwords, registration information such as your email&lt;br />
 address,birth date, gender, postal code and billing receipt&lt;br />
 details were potentially exposed. Credit card numbers are not&lt;br />
 stored by us and were not at risk. All payment data is handled&lt;br />
 by a secure 3rd party provider.
 &lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>
 Oh well. At least they hashed our passwords and secured the credit card
 transactions. All in all, I think they've handled themselves very well. Kudos
 for being so up front about this as well.

 The search dropdown feature of firefox has never been one of my favorite
 features. It just takes too long to switch between them, so I've mostly left
 it at google, and hoped it would be smart enough to understand what I mean.
 However, with linkhack, it just proxies through to google most of the time,
 but understands keywords such as 'imdb' to do a movie search, or 'img' to do a
 image search.
