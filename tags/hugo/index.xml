I am also using
&lt;a href="https://devenv.sh">devenv&lt;/a> to manage my development environments. This also includes the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/marcusramberg/blog/">blog&lt;/a>. This ensures I can easily build and run the blog locally, and keep up to
date with the latest Hugo version, without having to install anything on my host system. Devenv also provides easy
integration with &lt;a href="https://pre-commit.com/">pre-commit&lt;/a> to allow linting of the markdown files, and CI integration with
GitHub Actions.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Posting to Hugo from iOS</title><link>https://marcus.means.no/post/posting-to-hugo-from-ios/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.means.no/post/posting-to-hugo-from-ios/</guid><description>&lt;p>I like to take pictures, and some of the point for me of rebooting this blog was to have a place I control myself
to publish things, rather than relying on Facebook or Instagram to own my data. However, since my trusty iPhone is
my camera 99% of the time, that means I rely on having a simple way to post from the phone, otherwise it&amp;rsquo;s just not
going to happen.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Post to Hugo from ios with Editorial and Working Copy</title><link>https://marcus.means.no/post/hugo-editorial-workflow/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.means.no/post/hugo-editorial-workflow/</guid><description>&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick workflow to post to a Hugo blog on the go using Editorial and Working Copy.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
