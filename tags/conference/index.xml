Was great to see old friends from the Open Source community, but I still managed to get to the ULB on Saturday morning in time for my first talk.

Last week, we arranged Nordic Perl Workshop in Oslo. I've uploaded some pictures from the conference and the hackathon that was arranged at LinPro the weekend after. I've tagged all my photos with npw2009.</description></item></channel></rss>
