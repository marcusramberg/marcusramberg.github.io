The official beer event at Delirium was still cancelled, but a bunch of us still
gathered there on Friday afternoon. Was great to see old friends from the Open Source
community, but I still managed to get to the ULB on Saturday morning in time for my first talk.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Not a mind blowing beginning, but some nice suggestions for diagramming Kubernetes clusters,
like shaded boxes/color usage, creating things as zones rather than graphs with lines,
and to be sparing with the official icon set, as they are very sharp. Also a good suggestion,
split up a complicated drawing into two simpler ones.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pictures from Nordic Perl Workshop</title><link>https://marcus.means.no/post/2009-04-26-pictures-from-nordic-perl-workshop/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Apr 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.means.no/post/2009-04-26-pictures-from-nordic-perl-workshop/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marcusramberg/3474027957/" title="photo sharing">&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3351/3474027957_0b899d1830.jpg" alt="" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

Last week, we arranged Nordic Perl Workshop in Oslo. I've uploaded some pictures from the conference and the hackathon that was arranged at LinPro the weekend after. I've tagged all my photos with &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marcusramberg/tags/npw2009/">npw2009&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
