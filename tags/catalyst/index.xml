10:00 &lt; @rafl> but it still runs without a single modification. nice!

I plan to
do a series on extensions that I've found useful recently. To kick it off,
I'll feature a model which gives me a simple and useful admin interface to
my DBIx::Class models.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I first got involved with MVC Web Frameworks like Maypole and Ruby on
Rails, a big selling point was the ability to generate CRUD (Create/Read/
Update/Delete) interfaces to your data model. Ruby on Rails does this through
a mechanism called scaffolding, where it adds a set of actions to your
controller. It soon became apparent that these CRUD frameworks did not live
up to their promise as a base for creating your own custom actions. Usually,
you spend more time customizing these controllers than you would just
implementing the features you require.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Model adaptors for Catalyst.</title><link>https://marcus.means.no/post/2009-08-07-model-adaptors-for-catalyst/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Aug 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.means.no/post/2009-08-07-model-adaptors-for-catalyst/</guid><description>&lt;p>
 In a
 &lt;a href="http://blog.urth.org/2009/08/how-i-use-catalyst.html">recent post&lt;/a>
 Dave Rolsky points out some of his own best practices for Catalyst. While I've
 come around to agree with his first point, that Catalyst should generate a
 reusable config class for the user, I'm not so sure with regards to his model
 viewpoints.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
 For me, the strength of Catalyst's Model layer has always been the immense
 glue layer that allows me to configure any model in a predictable way. Much
 like DBI gives me a unified way to talk to databases, the Catalyst model-layer
 gives us a unified way of configuring models. In addition, we are able to
 provide helpers to create these models from the command line, reducing the
 work needed to set up a new model.

 Frew Schmidt has read the first four chapter of the
 &lt;a href="http://www.apress.com/book/view/9781430223658">new Catalyst book&lt;/a>
 and gives some first impressions:
&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
 &lt;p>
 So far though, I would say that the book is better than most programming
 books. Really, a lot of programming books need to be more like this, instead
 of focusing entirely on the arcana of one framework they should help you be
 a better programmer overall.
 &lt;/p>

 So, it seems that people are actually reading my ramblings. For instance,
 &lt;a href="http://lumberjaph.net/blog/">Franck Cuny&lt;/a> read my description of
 the
 &lt;a
 href="http://marcus.nordaaker.com/2009/05/awesome-route-graph-with-mojoxroutesasgraph/"
 >Mojo routes graph generator&lt;/a

 >Catalyst equivalent&lt;/a
 >. That is just so awesome!
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
 Frank says "For the moment only private actions are graphed.", hopefully, it
 can be extended to understand chained actions. I can't wait to test it out on
 the &lt;a href="http://iusethis.com/">iusethis&lt;/a> code base. Now I can just hand
 this graph to &lt;a href="http://arne.nordaaker.com/">Arne&lt;/a> when he wants to
 know which template matches which action.

 Apparently &lt;a href="http://catalystframework.org/">Catalyst&lt;/a> and
 DBIx::Class powers one of the biggest porn sites in the world,
 &lt;a href="http://youporn.com/">YouPorn&lt;/a>:
&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
 &lt;p>
 We operate one of the most visited Catalyst/DBIx::Class sites in the world
 with 90 million users and hundreds of millions of page views per day.
 &lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>
 They are looking for contractors all over the world. No matter what you might
 think of the content, the stack they are using seems cool, pretty much the
 same libraries we use to power &lt;a href="http://iusethis.com/">iusethis&lt;/a> and
 our other sites.

 Chintana Wilamuna has recently tried out Catalyst for the
 &lt;a href="http://engwar.com/post/93">Perl StockTrader&lt;/a> client:
&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
 &lt;p>
 This time however, I had slightly more time available so I started from
 Catalyst::Manual::Tutorial and boy, the docs are amazingly well written.
 Kennedy Clark has done a wonderful job with the documentation.
 &lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>
 Well deserved praise for Kennedy's work on the documentation. I think many
 people who tried out Catalyst in it's infancy don't realize how far the
 documentation has come since then.

 Our software site &lt;a href="http://iusethis.com/">i use this&lt;/a> is built on
 the MVC Framework &lt;a href="http://catalyst.perl.org/">Catalyst&lt;/a>. We
 currently run it using the Russian web server
 &lt;a href="http://wiki.codemongers.com/Main">Nginx&lt;/a> and standalone fastcgi
 servers. I am using the Moose based
 &lt;a href="http://search.cpan.org/~stevan/FCGI-Engine-0.06/">CGI::Engine&lt;/a>
 distribution by Stevan Little to start the servers. This module makes it
 really easy to manage your applications. You just create a YML config file
 like this:
&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>
---
- name: "iusethis-osx.server"
 nproc: 4
 scriptname: "/www/iusethis-osx/script/iusethis_fastcgi.pl"
 pidfile: "/var/run/iusethis-osx.pid"
 socket: "/var/run/iusethis-osx.sock" 
&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>
 with an entry for each server you want to run. (Note that the paths has been
 changed to protect the innocent.) Then you just create a simple perl script
 (See the
 &lt;a
 href="http://search.cpan.org/~stevan/FCGI-Engine-0.06/lib/FCGI/Engine/Manager.pm"
 >FCGI::Engine::Manager SYNOPSIS&lt;/a
 >
 for a sample), and you can easily start, stop and check the status for each
 application individually or every application in your config. If you have a
 system v style init, you can just stick the script in /etc/init.d/ and it will
 behave just like any of your other startup scripts.

 little bit more manually, and with a staging server to test larger roll-outs.

 So, a basic philosophy that Catalyst adopted from Perl itself is the famous
 There is more than one way to do it. Dan points out the fallacy of having to
 make too many choices when adopting a new framework. I disagree that that is a
 deciding factor in Rails or django having more web applications listed on
 appliedstack than Catalyst.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
 I believe the extreme Rails hyping and number of books coming out to be a
 critical Rails success factor, and Google choosing Django as it's only
 language for App Engine to be a critical Django one. Having said that, I do
 believe that having to make all of these choices up front, while learning a
 new framework, has been harmful to Catalyst adoption. I don't think we need to
 give up flexibility to fix that problem tho.

&lt;pre>use iusethis;&lt;/pre>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Then I can access my models like iusethis-&amp;gt;model('DBIC::Person') . However, all I really need is to get the application configuration, and loading a big application is a lot of overhead. Just using Config::Any isn't a good solution tho, since it does not handle _local files properly, among other thing.
