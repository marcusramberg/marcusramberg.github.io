The site is free to use, and we finance it through the use of advertisments. Mostly we get advertisments from the Google ads program, as well as indie shareware developers, and occationally promotional programs like macheist.
I figure Apple Products would be a good fit for our users, so I was pleased when a quick Google Search turned up the Apple Store Associates Program. <a href=/post/2009-03-06-the-hunt-for-the-apple-store-associates-program/>Read More...</a></section></article><article class=list-item itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Blog><h2 class=headline itemprop=headline><a href=/post/2009-03-04-big-oops-for-spotify/>Big oops for Spotify?</a></h2><div class=meta><span class=key>published on</span>

Along with passwords, registration information such as your email
address,birth date, gender, postal code and billing receipt

stored by us and were not at risk. All payment data is handled
by a secure 3rd party provider. Oh well. At least they hashed our passwords and secured the credit card transactions. <a href=/post/2009-03-04-big-oops-for-spotify/>Read More...</a></section></article><article class=list-item itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Blog><h2 class=headline itemprop=headline><a href=/post/2009-02-22-linkhack-a-smarter-search/>linkhack - a smarter search?</a></h2><div class=meta><span class=key>published on</span>

It just takes too long to switch between them, so I've mostly left it at google, and hoped it would be smart enough to understand what I mean. However, with linkhack, it just proxies through to google most of the time, but understands keywords such as 'imdb' to do a movie search, or 'img' to do a image search. <a href=/post/2009-02-22-linkhack-a-smarter-search/>Read More...</a></section></article></main><nav class=paginator><a class=nav-left href=/tags/webapps/>&lt; Prev</a>
