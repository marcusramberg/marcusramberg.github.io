Been looking for something like this for a long time.</description></item><item><title>Diggbar is sleazy</title><link>http://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2009-04-15-diggbar-is-sleazy/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Apr 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2009-04-15-diggbar-is-sleazy/</guid><description>So, there has been a lot of noise about the diggbar lately. I think Ted Dziuba of Uncov fame says it best:
This move shows that not only is Digg willing to pull some sleazy shit to increase their unique visitors, but that they also need to pull this sleazy shit, because they need more unique visitors.</description></item><item><title>Facebook vanity URLs</title><link>http://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2009-03-22-facebook-vanity-urls/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Mar 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2009-03-22-facebook-vanity-urls/</guid><description>Chris has a interesting analysis of a recent move by Facebook to support username urls:
Arrington has a post that claims that "Facebook is getting wise to something MySpace has known from the start - users love vanity URLs."
I don’t buy it. In fact, I’m pretty sure that the omission of vanity URLs on Facebook is an intentional design decision from the beginning, and one that I’ve learned to appreciate over time.</description></item><item><title>The Hunt For The Apple Store Associates Program</title><link>http://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2009-03-06-the-hunt-for-the-apple-store-associates-program/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Mar 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2009-03-06-the-hunt-for-the-apple-store-associates-program/</guid><description>As you might know, we run a software site for mac users, i use this. The site is free to use, and we finance it through the use of advertisments. Mostly we get advertisments from the Google ads program, as well as indie shareware developers, and occationally promotional programs like macheist.
I figure Apple Products would be a good fit for our users, so I was pleased when a quick Google Search turned up the Apple Store Associates Program.</description></item><item><title>Big oops for Spotify?</title><link>http://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2009-03-04-big-oops-for-spotify/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Mar 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2009-03-04-big-oops-for-spotify/</guid><description>I just received a mail from Spotify about a security issue:
Along with passwords, registration information such as your email
address,birth date, gender, postal code and billing receipt
details were potentially exposed. Credit card numbers are not
stored by us and were not at risk. All payment data is handled
by a secure 3rd party provider. Oh well. At least they hashed our passwords and secured the credit card transactions.</description></item><item><title>linkhack - a smarter search?</title><link>http://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2009-02-22-linkhack-a-smarter-search/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Feb 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2009-02-22-linkhack-a-smarter-search/</guid><description>The search dropdown feature of firefox has never been one of my favorite features. It just takes too long to switch between them, so I've mostly left it at google, and hoped it would be smart enough to understand what I mean. However, with linkhack, it just proxies through to google most of the time, but understands keywords such as 'imdb' to do a movie search, or 'img' to do a image search.</description></item></channel></rss>
