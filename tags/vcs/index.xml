I think this is a really good post by chris from github, illustrating the advantages of fully distributed development:
It may seem strange, and perhaps even like a lot of work. “Why should I have to check to see which is the most current? In the old model, there’s always a canonical repository.”
In the old model, actionwebservice wouldn’t have made it past 1.</description></item><item><title>Easy remote branches with git</title><link>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2009-03-12-easy-remote-branches-with-git/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Mar 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2009-03-12-easy-remote-branches-with-git/</guid><description>Think remote branch management is a hassle with git?

That model works well for Linux. Maybe. I'll presume it does. Git eases the pain points expressed by Andrew Morton, the maintainer of the -mm tree, in this message entitled "This Just Isn't Working Any More"
In short, it makes siloing easier.
My immediate reaction to reading his post was to think of the old saying ‹‹Guns don't kill people, people kill people››.</description></item><item><title>Using rebase with git pull</title><link>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2009-02-12-using-rebase-with-git-pull/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2009-02-12-using-rebase-with-git-pull/</guid><description>Great tip about using rebase when you pull from remote to get a cleaner git commit timeline.</description></item><item><title>eg makes it really easy for svn users to switch to git</title><link>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2009-02-04-eg-makes-it-really-easy-for-svn-users-to-switch-to-git/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2009-02-04-eg-makes-it-really-easy-for-svn-users-to-switch-to-git/</guid><description>Are you trying to sell in git to your colleagues, who are afraid of learning anything new? easy git might be the ticket to convince them.
