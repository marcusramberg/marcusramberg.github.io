 A few week back, I commented some concerns about
 &lt;a
 href="http://marcus.nordaaker.com/2009/03/git-results-in-silosgit-results-in-silos/"
 >git causing silos&lt;/a
 >. I think this is a really good post by chris from github, illustrating the
 advantages of fully distributed development:

 &lt;p>
 It may seem strange, and perhaps even like a lot of work. “Why should I have
 to check to see which is the most current? In the old model, there’s always
 a canonical repository.”
 &lt;/p>
 &lt;p>
 In the old model, action-web-service wouldn’t have made it past 1.2.6.
 Welcome to distributed version control.

 That model works well for Linux. Maybe. I'll presume it does. Git eases the
 pain points expressed by Andrew Morton, the maintainer of the -mm tree, in
 this message entitled "This Just Isn't Working Any More"
 &lt;/p>
 &lt;p>In short, it makes siloing easier.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>
 My immediate reaction to reading his post was to think of the old saying
 ‹‹Guns don't kill people, people kill people››. In fact, my experiences with
 forks so far has been two cases of forking repos on github, and doing a pull
 request to the author when my fixes were fit to be included in the main
 distribution. In both cases the authors included my changes in their versions.
