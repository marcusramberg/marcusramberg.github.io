&lt;blockquote>
 &lt;p>
 Along with passwords, registration information such as your email&lt;br />
 address,birth date, gender, postal code and billing receipt&lt;br />
 details were potentially exposed. Credit card numbers are not&lt;br />
 stored by us and were not at risk. All payment data is handled&lt;br />
 by a secure 3rd party provider.
 &lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>
 Oh well. At least they hashed our passwords and secured the credit card
 transactions. All in all, I think they've handled themselves very well. Kudos
 for being so up front about this as well.
