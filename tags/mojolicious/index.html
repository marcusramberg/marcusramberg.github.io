<span class=val><time itemprop=datePublished datetime=2014-05-27>May 27, 2014</time></span></div><section class=summary>This weekend I attended the MojoConf hackathon, which was great fun. I had some interesting talks with the rest of the core team, and I collaborated with Joel Berger on Mojo::PG, an adaptor for the Mojo::IOLoop for Postgres. Joel is almost done with a Pool implementation as well, and we&rsquo;ll probably be on CPAN sometime this week.
I also wrote a simple plugin-helper, which I think greatly simplify working with async controllers in Mojolicious. <a href=/post/2014-05-27-mojoliciouspluginrendersteps/>Read More...</a></section></article><article class=list-item itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Blog><h2 class=headline itemprop=headline><a href=/post/2011-12-31-a-mojolicious-2011/>A Mojolicious 2011.</a></h2><div class=meta><span class=key>published on</span>
<span class=val><time itemprop=datePublished datetime=2011-12-31>December 31, 2011</time></span></div><section class=summary>A new year is upon us, and I figured this would be good time to take a look at the improvements in the Mojolicious framework in the last year. There has been a dazzling number of releases, 122 in fact, including the current release, 2.42.
Some of the releases were mere bugfix releases, with nothing noteworthy to add, but I&#8217;ll try going through the major releases in the last year. When this year started, we already had a robust MVC Web framework, and through the year you will note that a lot of the work has gone into building a first class real time web framework. <a href=/post/2011-12-31-a-mojolicious-2011/>Read More...</a></section></article><article class=list-item itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Blog><h2 class=headline itemprop=headline><a href=/post/2011-12-04-visualization-of-the-mojo-class-tree/>Visualization of the Mojo class tree.</a></h2><div class=meta><span class=key>published on</span>
<span class=val><time itemprop=datePublished datetime=2011-12-04>December 04, 2011</time></span></div><section class=summary>In this visualization, I've tried to group the various Mojo classes by function and color code them. The classes are placed in layers, and related groups are close to each other. Note that I've dropped abstract base classes and Mojolicious related subclasses from this visualization, as well as some servers and all the commands. This might be useful as a quick reference, if you want to print it, you can get the PDF here. <a href=/post/2011-12-04-visualization-of-the-mojo-class-tree/>Read More...</a></section></article></main><nav class=paginator><span class="nav-left faded">&lt; Prev</span>
