 Interesting writeup from Justin Williams about the use of Tab Bars in iPhone
 development. One of his big gripes is related to the space the tab-bar uses:
&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
 &lt;p>
 When I made the decision, my thinking was that the application had four
 separate features, so it only made sense to separate them using the tab bar.
 What I found as I got further into the development of the application was
 that the bottom tab bar was incredibly limiting for where to place extra
 controls.

 &lt;a href="http://www.wulffmorgenthaler.com/">Wulffmorgenthaler&lt;/a> is one of
 the web comics I follow religiously through my feed reader. The other day
 their comic didn't want to load. I tried following the link to their page,
 only to be presented with
 &lt;a href="http://www.wulffmorgenthaler.com/error.htm"
 >One of the coolest error pages&lt;/a
 >
 I've seen. Of course, we all strive to keep our sites up 24/7. Still I think
 it is a sign of greatness to be able to put a smile on the lips of your
 readers even when your service your service is down.

 Lately I’ve been fiddling a bit with Markdown, John Gruber’s minimalist
 plain text markup syntax. I’ve become more and more attracted to Markdown
 after I’ve had to spend some time using Trac and, to a lesser degree, TWiki
 and MediaWiki. The plain-text markup syntax in these projects is…how shall I
 put this?… god-awful
 &lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>
 This is a big part of the reason why we chose
 &lt;a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown&lt;/a> along with
 &lt;a href="http://www.textism.com/tools/textile/">Textile&lt;/a> as the supported
 Wiki markup languages for &lt;a href="http://mojomojo.org/">MojoMojo&lt;/a>. Having
 edited some wikipedia-pages, as well as Trac , while we were using that for
 the &lt;a href="http://dev.catalyst.perl.org/">catalyst dev wiki&lt;/a>, I totally
 agree. Their markup language makes me want to hurl.

 One of Arne's long-standing wishes for our video bookmarking site
 &lt;a href="http://iwatchthis.com/">iwatchthis.com&lt;/a> has been proper keyboard
 navigation. Today I finally found some
 &lt;a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl5/index.cgi?tuit">tuits&lt;/a>, and
 Just Fucking Did It.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
 Turns out that with a couple of javascript libraries, it was surprisingly
 easy. Step one was the
 &lt;a href="http://www.openjs.com/scripts/events/keyboard_shortcuts/"
 >keyboard shortcuts&lt;/a
 >
 library, which let you hook up to keyboard input in this simple fashion:
&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>
 shortcut('up',function() {
 alert('Lucy in the sky with diamonds');
 })&lt;/pre
>
&lt;p>
 However, rather than bore you further you with Beatles lyrics, I hooked it up
 to the excellent
 &lt;a href="http://flesler.blogspot.com/2007/10/jqueryscrollto.html">scrollTo&lt;/a>
 jQuery extension, which lets you smoothly scroll to any anchor in in the page
 (I added anchors into the video item for convenience):
