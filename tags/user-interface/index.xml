One of his big gripes is related to the space the tabbar uses:
When I made the decision, my thinking was that the application had four separate features, so it only made sense to separate them using the tab bar. What I found as I got further into the development of the application was that the bottom tab bar was incredibly limiting for where to place extra controls.</description></item><item><title>Balsamiq Mockups look awesome.</title><link>https://marcus.means.no/post/2009-03-09-balsamic-mockups-look-awesome/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Mar 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.means.no/post/2009-03-09-balsamic-mockups-look-awesome/</guid><description>Go check out their screencast.

The other day their comic didn't want to load. I tried following the link to their page, only to be presented with One of the coolest error pages I've seen. Of course, we all strive to keep our sites up 24/7. Still I think it is a sign of greatness to be able to put a smile on the lips of your readers even when your service your service is down.</description></item><item><title>Adobe UI Gripes</title><link>https://marcus.means.no/post/2009-02-20-adobe-ui-gripes/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.means.no/post/2009-02-20-adobe-ui-gripes/</guid><description>Do not meddle in the affairs of designers, for they are subtle and quick to anger.

Lately I’ve been fiddling a bit with Markdown, John Gruber’s minimalist plain text markup syntax. I’ve become more and more attracted to Markdown after I’ve had to spend some time using Trac and, to a lesser degree, Twiki and MediaWiki. The plain-text markup syntax in these projects is…how shall I put this?… gawdawful
This is a big part of the reason why we chose Markdown along with Textile as the supported Wiki markup languages for MojoMojo.</description></item><item><title>Problems with star ratings</title><link>https://marcus.means.no/post/2009-02-14-problems-with-star-ratings/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.means.no/post/2009-02-14-problems-with-star-ratings/</guid><description>Steven Frank points to some of the issues with star ratings.

Today I finally found some tuits, and Just Fucking Did It. Turns out that with a couple of javascript libraries, it was surprisingly easy. Step one was the keyboard shortcuts library, which let you hook up to keyboard input in this simple fashion:
shortcut('up',function() { alert('Lucy in the sky with diamonds'); }) However, rather than bore you further you with Beatles lyrics, I hooked it up to the excellent scrollTo jQuery extension, which lets you smoothly scroll to any anchor in in the page (I added anchors into the video item for convenience):</description></item></channel></rss>
