Normally you would have to install a browser proxy on your machine to access TOR, but now there's a browser available for the iPad and iPhone.

I specially enjoyed this nugget:
I could read that over and over. Itâ€™s like the voice of a robot. The voice of authority. The voice of authoritative robots.</description></item><item><title>Good advice from mr.
