The site is free to use, and we finance it through the use of advertisement. Mostly we get advertisement from the Google ads program, as well as indie shareware developers, and on occasion promotional programs like Mac Heist.
I figure Apple Products would be a good fit for our users, so I was pleased when a quick Google Search turned up the Apple Store Associates Program.</description></item></channel></rss>
