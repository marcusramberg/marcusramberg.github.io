This module works by evaling everything from the use line as JavaScript. Of course, now you're mixing two languages in one file, which is not going to make any of your syntax validators happy. However, loading it like this will please both perl and jslint:
m| /* |; # Comment out JavaScript use Test::JavaScript::More; __END__ = ''; // It's is all JS from here.</description></item></channel></rss>
