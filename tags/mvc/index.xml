From the Author's description:
(PoC)yet another sinatra-ish framework built on CPAN module.
Rather than 'shaggadelic' or 'dance', this one starts the app with 'zigorou'. I can't see it catching on.</description></item><item><title>Slides from my Mojolicious presentation</title><link>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2010-03-07-slides-from-my-mojolicious-presentation/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Mar 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2010-03-07-slides-from-my-mojolicious-presentation/</guid><description>I recently held a introduction to the Mojolicious web framework for Oslo.pm.

a few times, I think I forgot to introduce myself the last time I made the
move. I am Marcus Ramberg, the writer of this blog, and director of
Nordaaker, a small British/Norwegian company currently run out of Oslo,
Norway. In addition to being my personal blog, at the time being this blog
acts as Nordaaker&amp;#8217;s dynamic english presence.</description></item><item><title>Model adaptors for Catalyst.</title><link>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2009-08-07-model-adaptors-for-catalyst/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Aug 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2009-08-07-model-adaptors-for-catalyst/</guid><description>In a recent post Dave Rolsky points out some of his own best practices for Catalyst. While I've come around to agree with his first point, that Catalyst should generate a reusable config class for the user, I'm not so sure with regards to his model viewpoints.

Viacheslav Tikhanovskii has taken this functionality and run with it, producing bootylicious - a ~280 SLOC web log system. It sorts a directory of POD formatted blog posts, and even supports RSS. I think these single file apps is an excellent way to demonstrate your framework. I actually remember this as being a selling point for Maypole back in the days :)</description></item></channel></rss>
