 After &lt;a href="http://www.mojomojo.org/">MojoMojo&lt;/a>, the CMS/Wiki software
 that powers
 &lt;a href="http://dev.catalyst.perl.org">dev.catalyst.perl.org&lt;/a> was featured
 prominently in the
 &lt;a href="http://use.perl.org/comments.pl?sid=42312&amp;cid=67298"
 >CPANTS Heavy 100&lt;/a
 >, there was some concern about how much time was required to install it.
 However, thanks to the illustrious dane Lars Balker Rasmussen, FreeBSD guys
 now have it easy. He's fought through our entire dependency list, and uploaded
 &lt;a href="http://www.freshports.org/www/p5-MojoMojo/">p5-MojoMojo&lt;/a> to the
 FreeBSD ports tree. Hopefully Debian packages won't be far behind.

 Aaron Swartz has been taking a closer look at Wales' claims that Wikipedia is
 being written by a small group of people.

 When you put it all together, the story become clear: an outsider makes one
 edit to add a chunk of information, then insiders make several edits
 tweaking and reformatting it. In addition, insiders rack up thousands of
 edits doing things like changing the name of a category across the entire
 site — the kind of thing only insiders deeply care about. As a result,
 insiders account for the vast majority of the edits. But it’s the outsiders
 who provide nearly all of the content.

 Lately I’ve been fiddling a bit with Markdown, John Gruber’s minimalist
 plain text markup syntax. I’ve become more and more attracted to Markdown
 after I’ve had to spend some time using Trac and, to a lesser degree, TWiki
 and MediaWiki. The plain-text markup syntax in these projects is…how shall I
 put this?… god-awful
 &lt;/p>

 This is a big part of the reason why we chose
 &lt;a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown&lt;/a> along with
 &lt;a href="http://www.textism.com/tools/textile/">Textile&lt;/a> as the supported
 Wiki markup languages for &lt;a href="http://mojomojo.org/">MojoMojo&lt;/a>. Having
 edited some wikipedia-pages, as well as Trac , while we were using that for
 the &lt;a href="http://dev.catalyst.perl.org/">catalyst dev wiki&lt;/a>, I totally
 agree. Their markup language makes me want to hurl.
