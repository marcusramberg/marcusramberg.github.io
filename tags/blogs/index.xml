a few times, I think I forgot to introduce myself the last time I made the
move. I am Marcus Ramberg, the writer of this blog, and director of
Nordaaker, a small British/Norwegian company currently run out of Oslo,
Norway. In addition to being my personal blog, at the time being this blog
acts as Nordaaker&amp;#8217;s dynamic english presence.</description></item><item><title>We Are Iron Man</title><link>https://marcus.means.no/post/2009-04-22-we-are-iron-man/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Apr 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.means.no/post/2009-04-22-we-are-iron-man/</guid><description>Went to visit the Oslo rubyists today just to get the old worn out 'But we heard perl is dead', as a welcome. So worn out. Somehow they acknowledge that python is a nice language tho. So why has nobody heard from us in a while? Matt has a theory.
But here's my point: Perl people hang out on mailing lists. We bottom post, carefully interleaved, with 76 character lines. We have signatures that meet the McQ standard for acceptable size.</description></item></channel></rss>
