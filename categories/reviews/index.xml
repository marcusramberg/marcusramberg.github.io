It&amp;rsquo;s mostly
been OK, but the price has been increasing every year, and they never upgrade our components,
so when I learned about the offering from &lt;a href="https://homely.no">Homely&lt;/a>, I was intrigued.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Basically you own your own components, and pay a monthly fee for monitoring. The components
are mostly &lt;code>Zigbee&lt;/code>-based, and there&amp;rsquo;s a home assistant integration to get the status into my
home assistant setup, so I decided to give it a go.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
