It&amp;rsquo;s mostly been OK, but the price has been increasing every year, and they never upgrade our components, so when I learned about the offering from Homely, I was intrigued.
Basically you own your own components, and pay a monthly fee for monitoring. The components are mostly Zigbee-based, and there&amp;rsquo;s a home assistant integration to get the status into my home assistant setup, so I decided to give it a go.</description></item></channel></rss>
