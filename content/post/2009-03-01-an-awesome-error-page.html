title: An awesome error page
---
<p><a href="http://www.wulffmorgenthaler.com/">Wulffmorgenthaler</a> is one of the web comics I follow religiously through my feed reader. The other day their comic didn't want to load. I tried following the link to their page, only to be presented with <a href="http://www.wulffmorgenthaler.com/error.htm">One of the coolest error pages</a> I've seen. Of course, we all strive to keep our sites up 24/7. Still I think it is a sign of greatness to be able to put a smile on the lips of your readers even when your service your service is down.</p>
