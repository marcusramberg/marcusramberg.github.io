<p>Mr Speaker is doing a series of posts on how to do 3d graphics with the HTML 5 Canvas:</p>
<li>This introductory post – to set up viewer expectations</li>
<li>A 3D starfield – to learn how to project points in 3D</li>
<li>2D shape rotation – gotta rotate stuff, and that seems hard</li>
<li>3D wireframe drawing – draw a cube! Yeah!</li>
<li>3D wireframe rotating & moving – spin it!</li>
<li>‘Shaded’ 3D model – colour it in.</li>
