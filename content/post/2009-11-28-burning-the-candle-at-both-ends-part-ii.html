title: Burning the candle at both ends part II
---
<p>In addition to recent fatherhood and doing my own startup and taking over the leadership of the Oslo Perl Mongers, I've started a project to get a hacker space set up in Oslo. Actually, this ties in to my Oslo Perl Mongers interests as well, so it's not a completely new project. I got very inspired by  <a href="http://twitter.com/kyrah">@kyrah</a>'s talk about <a href="http://metalab.at">metalab.at</a> in Wien at <a href="http://fscons.org">FSCons</a> in Gothenburg a couple of weeks ago. </p>
<p>I'd like to see something like this in Oslo, so I've set up a Wiki and started talking to various other interested parties. If this is something you would be interested in happening, please sign up at the <a href="http://hackerspaces.means.no">Wiki</a> and the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/oslo-hackerspace?lnk=srg">Google Group</a> and join the discussion.</p>
