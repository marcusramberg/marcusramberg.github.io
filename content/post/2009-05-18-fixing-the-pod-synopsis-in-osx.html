title: Fixing the POD synopsis in OSX
---
<p>Having problems copying example code from POD and getting invalid characters in your Perl? Apparently this is a problem with nroff on OS X (According to my linux hacking peeps), but the solution is quite simple. Just stuff this in your .profile or whatever ;)</p>
<p><code>alias perldoc='perldoc -t'</code></p>
<p>And your pod is rendered in glorious pure-text, without using weird characters for ' and -.</p>
