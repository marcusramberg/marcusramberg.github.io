title: Onion browser - TOR on IOS
---
<p>The Onion Router is a internet project that aims to anonymize your traffic by routing it through a darknet with various exit points to the Internet. Normally you would have to install a browser proxy on your machine to access TOR, but now there's a <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/onion-browser/id519296448?mt=8">browser available for the iPad and iPhone</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, I had to test it by checking out the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road_(marketplace)">Silk Road</a>, a much publicized "Amazon of illegal drugs" that only exists on the TOR network.</p>
