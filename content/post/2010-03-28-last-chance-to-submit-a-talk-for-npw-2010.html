title: Last chance to submit a talk for NPW 2010
---
<p>Thinking about submitting a talk for NPW 2010 in Reykjavik? The deadline for the Call for Paper is tomorrow, 29th of march, so you'd better hurry up and get that submission in there. I've submitted a talk, and am really looking forward to visit iceland. I've never been, but from the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?s=int&w=all&q=iceland+nature&m=text">photos I've seen</a> it seems like a beautyful place.</p>
