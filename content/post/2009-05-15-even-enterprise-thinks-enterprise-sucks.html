title: Even Enterprise thinks enterprise sucks
---
<p>Early in my career I worked for a large telco at. The term "Enterprise Software" still gives me me chills down the spine. Likewise terms like WS-* and SOA, which for me represents huge amounts of bloat and hatefulness.</p>
<p>This is in fact one of the reasons I prefer working in smaller more agile shops. Apparently, I'm not alone in disliking enterprise software. Software AG's "Chief Strategist" Miko Matsumura sums it up well:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Working with Enterprise Software feels a bit like walking through an industrial landfill or an airport hangar. Nothing is built to human scale.
