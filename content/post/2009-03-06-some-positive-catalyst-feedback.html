title: Some positive Catalyst-feedback
---
<p>Chintana Wilamuna has recently tried out Catalyst for the <a href="http://engwar.com/post/93">Perl StockTrader</a> client:</p>
<blockquote><p>This time however, I had slightly more time available so I started from Catalyst::Manual::Tutorial and boy, the docs are amazingly well written. Kennedy Clark has done a wonderful job with the documentation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well deserved praise for Kennedy's work on the documentation. I think many people who tried out Catalyst in it's infancy don't realize how far the documentation has come since then.</p>
