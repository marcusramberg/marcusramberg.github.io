title: ChromeOS does not a monopoly make.

<p>Chill out people. ChromeOS might be interesting and all, but it's not going to be killing any operating systems in the near future. Chrome has enough of a challenge keeping up with the other browsers, not to mention being able to replace modern desktop operating systems. As usual, Ted Dzuiba has dissected this situation with much more wit than I could muster:</p>
<blockquote><p>Keep whackin' away on that Pareto Principle and let us all know how it turns out. In the meantime, I'm going to go play a few rounds of Counterstrike on my Windows-based PC, because the best that my browser can do is Tetris. I'm sure that HTML5 will bridge that gap any day now.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Web apps are nice and all, but they're not replacing my Aqua apps anytime soon.</p>
