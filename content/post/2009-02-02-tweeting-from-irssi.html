title: Tweeting from irssi with twirc
---
<p>When I started out with twitter, I used the native OSX client <a href="http://osx.iusethis.com/app/twitterrific">Twitterrific</a>. It's a pretty nice piece of software, but I couldn't get comfortable with it popping up every time there was a new tweet, as it was a bit too disturbing, and if I turned it off, I forgot to check it out at all.</p>
<p>However, lately, I have a much better solution. I already communicate fairly frequently through the venerable Internet Relay Chat protocol (or IRC as most people know it). Thanks to <a href="http://github.com/semifor">semifor</a>, I now have Twitter as just another channel in my irssi screen:</p>
<div class="thumbnail"><a href="http://skitch.com/marcus/bd81x/default"><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20090202-bkds7empthpnkatjhm4kp9tsns.preview.jpg" alt="Default" /></a><br /><span style="font-family: Lucida Grande, Trebuchet, sans-serif, Helvetica, Arial; font-size: 10px; color: #808080">Uploaded with <a href="http://plasq.com/">plasq</a>'s <a href="http://skitch.com">Skitch</a>!</span></div>
<p>It runs as a separate process on my irc shell, pretending to be a IRC server. You can run it as a in the background, but for now I'm pretty happy with having it running as a new window in my screen session. Yes, I know that this setup marks me as a unrecoverable geek, but I don't care. It's just so sweet :-) If you don't have root privileges on your shell, you might find <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~apeiron/local-lib-1.003001/lib/local/lib.pm">local::lib</a> useful to install the required dependencies.</p>
