title: I love lazy web / Catalyst dispatcher graphs
---
<p>So, it seems that people are actually reading my ramblings.  For instance, <a href="http://lumberjaph.net/blog/">Franck Cuny</a> read my description of the <a href="http://marcus.nordaaker.com/2009/05/awesome-route-graph-with-mojoxroutesasgraph/">Mojo routes graph generator</a>. Then he took it upon himself to write the <a href="http://github.com/franckcuny/CatalystX--Dispatcher--AsGraph/tree/master">Catalyst equivalent</a>. That is just so awesome! </p>
<p>Frank says "For the moment only private actions are graphed.", hopefully, it can be extended to understand chained actions. I can't wait to test it out on the <a href="http://iusethis.com/">iusethis</a> code base. Now I can just hand this graph to <a href="http://arne.nordaaker.com/">Arne</a> when he wants to know which template matches which action.</p>
