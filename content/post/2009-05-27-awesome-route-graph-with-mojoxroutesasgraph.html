title: Awesome route graph with MojoX::Routes::AsGraph
---
<p>We are testing out Sebastian's <a href="http://mojolicious.org">Mojolicious</a> framework for use in a Nordaaker project. Mojolicious uses an routes-based dispatcher, which is nice, but sometimes it's hard to keep track of how everything is routed. Luckily <a href="http://www.simplicidade.org/notes/">Melo</a> already has an excellent solution for this:</p>
<div class="thumbnail"><a href="http://skitch.com/marcus/bt4fg/routes.dot"><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20090527-rk59hj6crbhd4e4cxurprmhche.preview.jpg" alt="routes.dot" /></a></p>
<p>Just check out <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~melo/MojoX-Routes-AsGraph-0.04/lib/MojoX/Routes/AsGraph.pm">MojoX::Routes::AsGraph</a> , which can generate these lovely graphs for you. It can even generate Ascii graphs, if you're a hard-core console user (Thanks to <a href="http://github.com/vti/">vti</a> for telling me about that, as well as showing me this module in the first place :).</p>
<pre>13:46 < vti>     my $graph = MojoX::Routes::AsGraph->graph($r)->as_ascii;</pre>
<p>With that the above graph looks something like this:</p>
<p><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20090527-e2rdsjsp297y9jdbfhxiufqmy6.png" alt="Default"/></p>
<p>Would be nice to see something similar for <a href="http://catalyst.perl.org">Catalyst</a>, to visualize all the chains and dispatch points.</div>
