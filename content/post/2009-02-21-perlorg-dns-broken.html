<pre>< @ask_> Looks like DirectI/resellerclub (the domain registrar) decided 
to  suspend perl.org!  I've no idea why.  They're not a communicative 
bunch.  Also, nice touch doing it on a Saturday.</pre>
<p>For now, if you need access to search.cpan.org, you can reach it directly by ip: <a href=" http://207.115.101.144/"> http://207.115.101.144/</a> Also, note that you can access the catalyst framework home page through <a href="http://www.catalystframework.org/">http://www.catalystframework.org/</a>. You can read more about it from <a href="http://www.askbjoernhansen.com/2009/02/21/perlorg_suspended_by_directicom_resellerclub.html">Ask's blog</a>.</p>
<p>*update* perl.org is back, serenity has been restored to the world. Hopefully they will also move to a less insane provider soon.</p>
