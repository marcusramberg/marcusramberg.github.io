Have some Prometheus queries that sometimes give no results? For instance error rate when there are no errors. Just append ~or vector(0) and the query will return 0 instead of an empty vector.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ragnarok</title><link>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2020-08-09-ragnarok/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Aug 2020 15:58:53 +0200</pubDate><author/><guid>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2020-08-09-ragnarok/</guid><description>&lt;figure>

However I&amp;rsquo;ve never found something nearly as powerful and efficient day to day as working on the command line.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While I will probably never give up the command line, with Emacs&amp;rsquo; Magit I&amp;rsquo;ve finally found a valuable companion which feels as powerful and efficient as the cli interface. The magit status window is a super powerful base point for most git operations. And with Magit Forge you can make it even more powerful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, to use Forge you need a github token. On macOS the best place to store such secrets is the OS Keychain, so I contributed &lt;a href="https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/pull/3311">a pull request to doom emacs&lt;/a> to make it support the keychain for auth storage. Check out the &lt;a href="https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/tree/develop/modules/tools/macos">MacOS doom module&lt;/a> for more documentation.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Modern rust alternatives for Unix classics</title><link>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2020-07-31-modern-rust-alternatives-for-unix-classics/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Jul 2020 23:16:04 +0200</pubDate><author/><guid>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2020-07-31-modern-rust-alternatives-for-unix-classics/</guid><description>&lt;p>I use several of these&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Wild pokecat appears</title><link>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2020-07-29-a-wild-pokecat-appears/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Jul 2020 00:22:10 +0200</pubDate><author/><guid>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2020-07-29-a-wild-pokecat-appears/</guid><description>&lt;figure>

My main home server is a NixOS box, but for a long while I was running home assistant on my old Arch mac mini, because it was such a chore to handle dependencies with the NixOS home assistant service.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Typically home assistant just installs what you need on the fly, but with the nixos version you need to declare everything manually. However, this winter I migrated over to running NixOS in a docker container declaratively. Recent nixos has gained support for running these containers in systemd.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Setting this up is really easy&lt;/p>

};
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Here I&amp;rsquo;m using the official image, and also demonstrating how to set extra docker options, like host networking or forwarding a usb device.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nixos also provides other commonly used services natively as nix services.&lt;/p>

extraConf &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;log_type debug&amp;#34;&lt;/span>;
};
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Now you can also easily upgrade your install by changing the docker image version and doing &lt;code>nixos-rebuild switch&lt;/code>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Typographical booty</title><link>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2020-07-18-typographical-booty/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Jul 2020 12:43:29 +0200</pubDate><author/><guid>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2020-07-18-typographical-booty/</guid><description>&lt;p>For once comic sans isn’t the worst.&lt;/p>

&lt;small>photo by denisb&lt;/small>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I used 1 kg of ground beef for 4 burgers, and seasoned with salt, pepper, paprika powder, two ts of bbq sauce, a squirt of mint chilli sauce.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To make the burgers, I use a &lt;a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000689186890.html">stuffed burger press&lt;/a>, and make a cup for the filling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To make the filling, take a box of cream cheese and whip it a bit to loosen. Dice an avocado, slice some basil leaves, and mix it in. Then use a spoon to fill the burger, finally put a lid of meat on top, and seal by squeezing gently on the press. use a knife to loose from the press after evicting, and bbq until scrumptious. Add a slice of blue cheese after flipping :)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Emacs lsp-mode 7.0 released</title><link>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2020-07-02-emacs-lsp-mode-7-dot-0-released/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><author/><guid>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2020-07-02-emacs-lsp-mode-7-dot-0-released/</guid><description>&lt;p>LSP support in Emacs is first class, and this release improves it even further.

I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to do something to automate watering schedules for our the micro drip system and our lawn and even ordered a solenoid valve from the internets a while back. It arrived a couple of weeks ago, and with a rainy sunday, I was finally ready to tackle this project.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="https://marcus.nordaaker.com/images/wiring.jpg"
alt="Valve control wiring"/>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Basically I just combined a z-wave light switch with the solenoid switch, stuffed it into a waterproof box and connected it to the water hose. I also added some heat shrink with glue to waterproof the solenoid sensor. I took some leftover connectors I had to attach it to a garden hose connector. Presto:&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Now with this setup I can easily set up home assistant automations to do watering schedules while we&amp;rsquo;re on vacation, and even integrate with YR to skip rainy days. And no cloud required :) Also, if it short circuits for some reason, it will default to being off. As a potential improvement I&amp;rsquo;m considering adding a flow gauge so that I can measure how much water I&amp;rsquo;m pouring into the garden, and to shut it down if there&amp;rsquo;s suddenly a drastic flow increase.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Multi-arch docker images</title><link>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2020-06-20-multi-arch-docker-images/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jun 2020 20:47:38 +0200</pubDate><author/><guid>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2020-06-20-multi-arch-docker-images/</guid><description>&lt;p>Nice example including github actions workflow.

Apple just doubled down on their rejection of HEY&amp;#39;s ability to provide bug fixes and new features, unless we submit to their outrageous demand of 15-30% of our revenue.

&lt;p>Apparently the rule is now that you cannot have any app related to a paid web service, unless you allow the user to subscribe through the App Store, and give Apple 30%. No matter if you provide links to your site or allow signing up in the app.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wonder if this would still apply if you provide an open source version of your app, but also a paid service for that same open source app?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;d like to think Apple gets punished for these mafia tactics, but realistically I guess there&amp;rsquo;s litte chance of that, unless the EU intervenes. For all his swagger, Trump is unlikely to even understand the issue at hand.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>View from train office</title><link>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2020-06-15-view-from-train-office/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jun 2020 08:28:13 +0200</pubDate><author/><guid>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2020-06-15-view-from-train-office/</guid><description>&lt;figure>

This is a service that allows hosts behind NAT to communicate peer to peer with webrtc. STUN is helping to negotiate port/ip and TURN will proxy the actual traffic if all else fails.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re using this with &lt;a href="https://convos.chat/">Convos&lt;/a>&amp;rsquo; video IRC feature, but the same applies to other WebRTC projects.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="installation">Installation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ll be assuming you&amp;rsquo;re on Ubutunu for this tutorial, so users on other distros will have to adjust the setup for their environment. First we&amp;rsquo;ll install the actual ubuntu package. If you don&amp;rsquo;t already have it, you will also need letsencrypt to generate valid ssl certs.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="code">
&lt;div>&lt;/div>
&lt;p>apt-install coturn certbot&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Then we edit &lt;code>/etc/turnserver.conf&lt;/code> - It should look roughly like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="code">
&lt;div>&lt;/div>
&lt;p>listening-port=3478
tls-listening-port=5349&lt;/p>
&lt;p>listening-ip=&lt;server public interface>
relay-ip=&lt;Ip used for relaying>
external-ip=&lt;actual external ip>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>realm=example.org
server-name=coturn.example.org&lt;/p>
&lt;p>fingerprint
lt-cred-mech&lt;/p>
&lt;p>user username:pass&lt;/p>
&lt;p>cert=/etc/letsencrypt/live/coturn.example.org/fullchain.pem
pkey=/etc/letsencrypt/live/coturn.example.org/privkey.pem
cipher-list=&amp;quot;ECDH+AESGCM:ECDH+CHACHA20:DH+AESGCM:ECDH+AES256:DH+AES256:ECDH+AES128:DH+AES:RSA+AESGCM:RSA+AES:!aNULL:!MD5:!DSS&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="set-up-letsencrypt-dot">Set up letsencrypt.&lt;/h2>
&lt;div class="code">
&lt;div>&lt;/div>
&lt;p>$ sudo certbot certonly &amp;ndash;standalone &amp;ndash;preferred-challenges http \&lt;br>
&amp;ndash;deploy-hook &amp;ldquo;systemctl restart coturn&amp;rdquo; \&lt;br>
-d coturn.example.com&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>certbort will automatically set up renewal of the certificate&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now let&amp;rsquo;s enable the service. Add &lt;code>TURNSERVER_ENABLED=1&lt;/code> to /etc/default/coturn and then
&lt;code>systemctl start coturn&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="convos-configuration">Convos configuration&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To use such a server with Convos, it requires a couple of environment variables to be set:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="code">
&lt;div>&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Environment=CONVOS_STUN=stun://user:pass@coturn.example.&amp;lt;5349&amp;gt;
Environment=CONVOS_TURN=turn://user:pas@coturn.example.&amp;lt;5349&amp;gt;&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>(Assuming you run Convos under systemd)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Remember to &lt;code>systemctl daemon-reload&lt;/code> and &lt;code>restart&lt;/code> after updating the service :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re running convos a different way like under &lt;a href="https://convos.chat/doc/start#docker">Docker&lt;/a>, adjust the relevant settings.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Graabein redux</title><link>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2020-06-12-graabein-redux/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jun 2020 21:00:11 +0200</pubDate><author/><guid>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2020-06-12-graabein-redux/</guid><description>&lt;figure>

However, since my trusty iPhone is my camera 99% of the time, that means I rely on having a simple way to post from the phone, otherwise it&amp;rsquo;s just not going to happen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Luckily, with IOS 13, Power users have a much improved tool for these kind of workflows. I started writing my first workflow, and was amazed by how easy and powerful it is. I was able to make a share extension for photos that just asks for a post title and then posts directly to my github blog repo. &lt;a href="https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2020-06-11-oslo-sunset/">This sunset&lt;/a> is an example of a post using this workflow :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you want to borrow my workflow, it&amp;rsquo;s avilable through icloud &lt;a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/99d972dc7de74d29aee41f1e089953c3">here&lt;/a> - I&amp;rsquo;ll also go through it step by step to quickly explain how it work&lt;/p>

&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="https://marcus.nordaaker.com/images/ios-hugo-photos-1.jpg"
alt="Workflow Part 1"/>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>First I resize the photo to a more handy format, as the iPhone pictures out of the box takes about 2 MB, which is a bit much for a web page.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Then I tell working copy to pull latest posts to make sure we&amp;rsquo;re not behind&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We ask for a title and set that to a variable&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="https://marcus.nordaaker.com/images/ios-hugo-photos-2.jpg"
alt="Workflow Part 2"/>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Then replace spaces in the url to create a slug,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add the picture to static images in the blog photo with date formated as yyyy-mm-dd and our slug&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="https://marcus.nordaaker.com/images/ios-hugo-photos-3.jpg"
alt="Workflow Part 3"/>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Create a text document with the post content including publish date and the photo tag&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Write that to the corresponding post filename.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Finally commit and push to remote.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>To give credit where credit is due, most of the heavy lifting here is done by &lt;a href="https://workingcopyapp.com/">Working Copy&lt;/a> - it&amp;rsquo;s a fantastic and fully featured git client for ios. If you do anything with git, it&amp;rsquo;s worth buying.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-future">The Future&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This workflow is enough for me to be able to do simple posts, but of course it could be improved. Things I&amp;rsquo;m considering are allowing custom tags, and getting metadata from exif.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Oslo Sunset</title><link>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2020-06-11-oslo-sunset/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jun 2020 12:08:18 +0200</pubDate><author/><guid>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2020-06-11-oslo-sunset/</guid><description>&lt;figure>

&lt;p>After buying A little toy quad copter this summer, I got very interested in RC flying. My wife would probably say obsessed. :) In particular I&amp;rsquo;m interested in First Person View racing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is a hobby where you crash a lot, so I decided to build it from scratch so I would be able to service it. Turns out it is a lot of work! Yesterday I finally reached my goal of flying FPV, and it was glorious. This post is about some of the pitfalls I met on the way, so you might avoid them.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="bought-a-glass-fiber-frame">Bought a glass fiber frame&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Glass fiber is cheap, but it&amp;rsquo;s heavier and softer than carbon fiber. I&amp;rsquo;m now slowly replacing all the parts. One upside of glass fiber is that it does not conduct electricity. But really, you want carbon fiber.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="discharged-my-lipo">Discharged my lipo&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In order to power a quad, you need to discharge a lot of electricity in a short time. The best batteries for this task are lithium polymer batteries. They capable of discharging a lot of amps. However they have some significant disadvantages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For one they are highly flammable. What I didn&amp;rsquo;t know is that they get unstable and unable to hold charge. While I was building and testing, the motors suddenly stopped. Turned out I had depleted it, and my charger refused to charge it. I tried forcing it to take current, but when it started heating up and swelling I decided to accept defeat and bought another.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="put-the-motors-on-in-the-wrong-order">Put the motors on in the wrong order&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In order to create lift, quadcopters need to have two clockwise and and two counterclockwise motors. Brushless motors can spin both ways. You just need to switch two of the cables to change the direction. Unfortunately the screws holding the propellers are ordered. I mixed up these, so the propellers kept unscrewing themselves when I was attempting to take off. Spectacular fail. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to remount all the motors, so I changed the flight controller to use a custom mix, and reversed the order of all my motors.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="put-the-flight-controller-in-the-wrong-orientation">Put the flight controller in the wrong orientation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>My first test flight was quite disheartening. As soon as I tried taking off, the copter flipped around and broke its propellers. After some digging, I realized this was because the I had mounted the naze32 flight controller sideways. Luckily you can tell the flight controller which direction is forwards. You can see if you have this problem by checking the visualization of the copter in cleanflight configurator&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="attached-the-motors-with-nylon-screws">Attached the motors with nylon screws&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>One bright idea I had when building the copter was using nylon screws to attach my motors. The thinking was that I would rather have the motor come off than break an arm in a crash. That part worked fine, however the nylon screws can&amp;rsquo;t take all the load from the motors, so they started snapping even when I wasn&amp;rsquo;t crashing. This meant I needed to remount all the motors after all.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="bought-the-wrong-kind-of-58ghz-antenna">Bought the wrong kind of 5.8ghz antenna.&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I didn&amp;rsquo;t know this, but there&amp;rsquo;s two different standards for the 5.8 ghz antennas commonly used for video transmission from the copter to the pilot. One is SMA, and the other is RP-SMA. Of course I managed to buy the wrong one, and ended up with two male pins facing each other. Not good! Fortunately, I managed to find an adapter at the newly opened &lt;a href="http://kjell.com/">kjell &amp;amp; co&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These are the main mistakes I&amp;rsquo;ve made so far. I&amp;rsquo;m still a newbie in this hobby, but I&amp;rsquo;m hoping that I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to increase my build-to-fly ratio in the next months, and work more on my pilot skills. I still have some improvements planned tho, for one I probably need to make the quad more winter proof. I&amp;rsquo;m sure I still have many mistakes to come :)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Too much scifi not enough MCs</title><link>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2015-09-30-too-much-scifi-not-enough-mcs/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Sep 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author/><guid>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2015-09-30-too-much-scifi-not-enough-mcs/</guid><description>&lt;p>Once again, it&amp;rsquo;s the end of the month, and I did not manage to keep my promise to myself, and write my blog posts earlier than last month. So, in order to not lose my bet with @jhthorsen, I will tell you about the last four books I finished. It just so happens they are all scifi, and they are all set in the near future, even if their themes are quite different.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="seveneves">Seveneves&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="by-neal-stephenson">By Neal Stephenson&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been following Neal Stephenson for a long time, after he hooked me with the magnificent Snow Crash and The Diamond Age. Although he almost lost me with the sometimes long winded Baroque cycle, I feel like he&amp;rsquo;s returning to old form lately, with REAMDE, which I enjoyed very much, and now Seveneves.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A meteorite has hit the moon, and shattered it into pieces. In itself this is a huge event, but earth scientists soon calculate that it will spell the end of most life on earth, and start exploring alternatives for survival. This book follows one of the most promising plans, making the international space station into an Ark where mankind can survive until earth once more is inhabitable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As you can imagine, life in space is not without peril, and I found myself turning the pages quite quickly as we approached the climax. The somewhat cryptic title of this book is related to the ending, but I won&amp;rsquo;t say more than that. Definitely worth checking out.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-martian">The Martian&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="by-andy-weir">By Andy Weir&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I first heard about this book through the trailer for the blockbuster movie adoption coming out this fall. The concept of a astronaut stranded on Mars seemed very interesting, so both me and the spouse decided to read the book first.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While not as far reaching as Seveneves, the survival story is quite strong, and the writing is witty, and sprinkled with scientific tidbits that keep you interested throughout the book. Some of the drama in the book seemed a little forced, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t enjoy the bits going on at Houston as much as the space survival parts. Still had a good time, and we will be getting a baby sitter to see this one in the cinema.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-periphial">The Periphial&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="by-william-gibson">By William Gibson&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Gibson was one of my favorite writers growing up. Books like Neuromancer, The Difference Engine and Mona Lisa overdrive shaped my views on the near future. While I also enjoyed his contemporary works, I have to say that even more than with Neal Stephenson, this book represents an explosive return to old form.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The book is set in two different time lines. One is a bleak near future, with sprawls and cyborg warriors, quite similar to his older books. In the other timeline we are quite a bit further into the future. Humanity has survived near extinction, and have developed quite advanced telemetry and genetic technology which allows them to create remotely controlled &amp;ldquo;meat puppets&amp;rdquo;. These two timelines start to converge as a mysterious worm hole is formed between them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I enjoyed all of this book, and I think you will too. It didn&amp;rsquo;t hurt that autonomous quadcopters played an important role either.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="armada">Armada&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="by-ernst-cline">By Ernst Cline&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This is the second book from Cline, after the very popular Ready a Player One, which tapped into pop culture nostalgia around 80s arcade gaming, together with a pervasive virtual world, to make a very popular and entertaining book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have tried very hard not to judge this book based on his debut novel. The story is a bit similar to Orson Scott Card&amp;rsquo;s Ender&amp;rsquo;s Game, with a young boy fighting aliens. however I think the writing is not nearly as good.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was also bored with a lot of the fpv multiplayer references. I don&amp;rsquo;t really enjoy these kinds of games, so I guess a lot of the pop references was lost on me. Still, it&amp;rsquo;s a decent youth novella, but not in the same class as the previous three.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Porting AnsibleModule to Perl.</title><link>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2015-08-31-porting-ansiblemodule-to-perl/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Aug 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author/><guid>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2015-08-31-porting-ansiblemodule-to-perl/</guid><description>&lt;pre>&lt;code>“All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.”
― George Orwell, Animal Farm
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Ansible is a great orchestration tool, which I&amp;rsquo;ve used extensively for the last years to build infrastructure, or even to accomplish routine tasks like restarting a group of web servers one by one or patching a bunch of servers for critical security issues.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ansible is written in Python, but you can write modules in anything that can generate JSON. In fact, I wrote about &lt;a href="">making a Perl based cloudflare module&lt;/a> earlier. However, to quote &lt;a href="">the official documentation&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>As mentioned, if you are writing a module in Python, there are some very powerful shortcuts you can use. Modules are still transferred as one file, but an arguments file is no longer needed, so these are not only shorter in terms of code, they are actually FASTER in terms of execution time.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Python is a fine language, but I&amp;rsquo;m more efficient at writing Perl, so I set out to port AnsibleModule to Perl. However, as I started looking at this new style of argument parsing, I got increasingly horrified. Seems that native Ansible modules are pre-processed to insert a lot of boilerplate code, including the passed arguments passed as a Python struct. Parsing this isn&amp;rsquo;t really feasible from any other language than Python, so I decided to use the JSON support for non-native modules instead. Unfortunately, this argument passing still happens by passing a filename on the command line to the module, and the module slurping this in. Ansible also slurps in the entire file into memory to look for the WANT_JSON flag.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the future I would love to see the module runner checking if the module opens STDIN, and pass the the module arguments directly as a JSON struct. This seems like the most efficient and agnostic way to go. Reliably detecting if stdin is open over ssh &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/911168/how-to-detect-if-my-shell-script-is-running-through-a-pipe">might be troublesome&lt;/a>, but even an explicit way of setting JSON_MODE (ENV?) would be an improvement over today&amp;rsquo;s situation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Using my AnsibleModule port still provides quite a bit of convenience though. For instance, you can do complex argument checking easily:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> my $m = AnsibleModule-&amp;gt;new(
argument_spec =&amp;gt; {
name =&amp;gt; {required =&amp;gt; 1},
enabled =&amp;gt; {default =&amp;gt; 0, aliases =&amp;gt; [qw/turned_on active/]},
type =&amp;gt; {type =&amp;gt; choices =&amp;gt; [qw/one two three/]},
similar =&amp;gt; {type =&amp;gt; 'dict'}
},
required_one_of =&amp;gt; [qw/type similar/]
);
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>Note that due to the malleability of Perl, we don&amp;rsquo;t really care about typing beyond String/List/Dict and Bool (which supports the same values as the Python AnsibleModule bools). Everything else is treated as a scalar.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>AnsibleModule also helps with supporting check mode in your module, just like the original Python module. I also provide &lt;a href="">Test::AnsibleModule&lt;/a> which lets you simply write unit tests for your module. As a convenience, you can test this module directly through the ansible-perl script command like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> ansible-perl -p -m &amp;lt;module&amp;gt; -a '{&amp;quot;foo&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;bar&amp;quot;}'
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>Use -h to see all the available options. The -p flag means ansible-perl uses &lt;a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/App::FatPacker">App::Fatpacker&lt;/a> to help you pack up your dependencies inside your Ansible module (as long as they are pure Perl). &lt;a href="http://mojolicio.us/">Mojolicious&lt;/a> is fat-packable, and provides a great basis for writing HTTP-related Ansible modules. Incidentally I used it to write AnsibleModule as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a bonus, if you fatpack your modules, you will automatically include the WANT_JSON text that Ansible is looking for in your module source code. Note that if you don&amp;rsquo;t want to pack your module, you will have to include it yourself somewhere in your source code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once you&amp;rsquo;ve packed your module, you can just put it into library/ in your Ansible project, and use it directly. As long as your hosts have Perl installed, everything should just work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m still putting the finishing touches on the module for the cpan 0.1 release, but meanwhile you can get it from &lt;a href="http://github.com/marcusramberg/AnsibleModule">GitHub&lt;/a>. Please create an issue or make a pull request if you find any bugs or you miss any features. It might also be useful to look at the &lt;a href="https://github.com/marcusramberg/AnsibleModule/tree/master/t/ext">examples&lt;/a> used in the unit tests.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>offline decentralized single sign-on in the browser</title><link>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2015-01-15-desentralized-passwordless-browser-auth/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author/><guid>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2015-01-15-desentralized-passwordless-browser-auth/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>

infrastructure using &lt;a href="http://ansible.com/">Ansible&lt;/a>. This lets us easily do
zero downtime releases and create new workers as needed to scale. We&amp;rsquo;ve got
roles for haproxy, postgresql, nginx, our app servers and a lot more. One thing
we&amp;rsquo;ve been handling manually so far is DNS. We&amp;rsquo;re happy Cloudflare users, and
they have one of the best DNS admin tools I&amp;rsquo;ve used, but still I felt like we
could do better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My friend &lt;a href="http://thorsen.pm">Jan Henning&lt;/a> also felt this way, and had already
written
&lt;a href="http://search.cpan.org/~jhthorsen/Mojo-Cloudflare-0.03/README.pod">Mojo::Cloudflare&lt;/a>,
a simple API client for Cloudflare. Even tho Ansible is Python-based, you can
write your plugins in whatever language you like, so I decided to glue the two
together. This turned out to be quite easy. First you need to tell ansible you
can handle json:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>#!/usr/bin/env perl
# WANT_JSON
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>Then we get the module argument file from the args, and parse the JSON:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>use Mojo::JSON;
use Mojo::Util qw/slurp/;
my $json = Mojo::JSON-&amp;gt;new;
my $args = $json-&amp;gt;decode(slurp($ARGV[0]));
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>And then you just process those arguments and do your thing. Lets say you want
to check for required arguments:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>for (qw/email api_key zone name/) {
fail(&amp;quot;$_ is a required argument&amp;quot;) unless exists $args-&amp;gt;{$_};
}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>My fail method looks like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>sub fail {
my $msg = shift;
print $json-&amp;gt;encode({failed =&amp;gt; 1, message =&amp;gt; $msg});
exit 1;
}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>The important thing here is to exit 1, the json response is icing on the cake.
For success you could could do something like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>print $json-&amp;gt;encode({changed =&amp;gt; \$changed, record =&amp;gt; $current-&amp;gt;id});
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>Note the bool reference to make Mojo::JSON return true/false. &lt;code>$changed&lt;/code>
will make the difference between OK and CHANGED output in your ansible run.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Put your module in a library/ sub directory of your playbook folder, and you
can just use it in your playbook like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>local_action: cloudflare zone=theoutput.co name=sentry type=CNAME
content=sentry.nordaaker.com service_mode=1 email={{cloudflare_user}}
api_key={{cloudflare_api_key}}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>I store my Cloudflare credentials in an ansible-vault and just include that in
my playbook. Note that using this module will require having the latest version
of Mojo::Cloudflare installed. If you want to run it on the remote server
rather than as a local_action, that server must also have the module.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyways, if you want to try it yourself, you can find the latest version of my
cloudflare ansible module

As we&amp;rsquo;re inching closer to 1.0, we&amp;rsquo;ve been focusing on polishing the user
interface, fixing bugs and other rough patches in the user experience.
One of the most important improvements in this round is how you switch
between conversations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Previously, when you pressed shift+enter, we shifted focus to the conversation list
on the top, to let you tab through your most recent conversations . Now, shift enter
will open up a panel on your right hand, where you can tab through all known
channels and usernames, or you can start typing to filter the list. You can
even join a new channel by typing in a unknown channel name and selecting the
server to join on (if you have more than one).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.evernote.com/shard/s22/sh/493629eb-7410-4807-8b9a-77ffdfcb008c/1a67e008fb5105064c856aab56226b57/deep/0/Nordaaker-demo----mojo-on-perlorg---oh-hai!.png" alt="Change channel dialog">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The same list is available by hitting the hamburger menu to the right of the
channel list, and of course this works just as well on mobile.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.evernote.com/shard/s22/sh/82aeb0af-cdf8-4b6c-8c26-7db02cfb1ecf/65c5c8c90bab5007ea6c697b00223b42/deep/0/Screenshot-01.09.14-13-52.png" alt="Change on mobile">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve also replaced the dropdowns on the top with slide in panels that works
more smoothly both on the desktop and mobile.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another new feature in the 0.8 series that I really enjoy is the recent activity line.
We now track whenever a channel goes out of focus, either because you switch
to another tab, or to another channel. When you return, there&amp;rsquo;s a line showing you
what&amp;rsquo;s new since you switching away.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.evernote.com/shard/s22/sh/6ecc7f7d-3784-4f17-b2ed-398ac12ba558/10a5b6575f6438be4abcc9c66c01adae/deep/0/Nordaaker-demo----mojo-on-perlorg---oh-hai!.png" alt="screenshot of activity line">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Desktop notifications, which was broken in 0.7, has been fixed and improved a
lot as well. Now, we ask you if you want desktop notifications like this - it
works in all major browsers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.evernote.com/shard/s22/sh/d3453d9b-d20a-4896-93c2-7c229b4ed991/569988001dab2c4495f76fc279ae14c7/deep/0/Nordaaker-demo----uberadmins-on-linpro.png" alt="screenshot of notificationquestion">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve also changed the way web sockets are handled, now we always load new
messages on web socket connect, significantly improving stability and
performance. We&amp;rsquo;ve also added some more irc commands. You can now /kick people,

I had
some interesting talks with the rest of the core team, and I collaborated with
Joel Berger on &lt;a href="http://github.com/marcusramberg/mojo-pg">Mojo::PG&lt;/a>, an adaptor for the Mojo::IOLoop for Postgres.
Joel is almost done with a Pool implementation as well, and we&amp;rsquo;ll probably be
on CPAN sometime this week.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also wrote a simple plugin-helper, which I think greatly simplify working
with async controllers in Mojolicious. This what you have to do to setup async
actions in mojolicious at the moment:&lt;/p>

give me various links to &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/jaygooby/504875">this one&lt;/a> -
It&amp;rsquo;s a nice and simple script, but it has a couple of issues. For one, it&amp;rsquo;s
missing the LSB header, and more importantly it is missing status.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This does not make Ansible very happy, as it is using the status to check if
the service is running before enforcing state=stopped or state=running. I spent
some time tracking this down, so I wanted to share a fixed version with LSB
headers and status implemented, in case someone else has the same problem.&lt;/p>

deployment and production systems. To this end, I&amp;rsquo;ve spent a lot of time
working with virtualization, Docker and automation recently. I&amp;rsquo;ll try to share
some of our experiences here in the months to come. One of our biggest
challenges has been to get a good testing culture internally. To that end, I
wanted a solid solution for CI.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This seems like a solved problem. Just fire up Jenkins, and you&amp;rsquo;re done.
However, there are always complications. Hard to install dependencies, Selenium
tests, required infrastructure services. That is why I have grown to love
&lt;a href="http://github.com/drone/drone">Drone&lt;/a>. Run your test suite in a clean docker
image every time, cache your dependencies (just like Heroku does), and run a
deploy action of your choice if the test succed. Drone also supports various
notification mechanisms, including Email (of course), IM and our favorite
Slack.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It also has support for a host of linked services, including PostgreSQL, MySQL,
MongoDB and Redis, but writing your own is also easy if needed. I&amp;rsquo;ve added
support to Beanstalkd for us, and plan to contribute this back soon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To make this even sweeter, I&amp;rsquo;ve coupled Drone with
&lt;a href="http://dokkuapp.com/">Dokku&lt;/a>, a simple Heroku like PAAS built on top of
Docker. We follow the &lt;a href="http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html">Github
flow&lt;/a>, and this setup
allows us to automatically stage all feature branches that pass their tests.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Installing dokku and drone is simple enough, and well documented in their
respective projects, so I won&amp;rsquo;t cover that here. However, here is the
.drone.yml config we use in the Output web backend repository:&lt;/p>

&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">on_failure&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">true&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">script&lt;/span>:

- sudo chown ubuntu:ubuntu /tmp/bundler

- &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#39;perl deploy.pl&amp;#39;&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s go through it quickly; The backend is built on Padrino, and we run it
using the most recent ruby image. The cache setting is to avoid having to
reinstall all the rubygems on every test run, and then we setup ENV for the
Database connection as well as setting padrino in test mode, and the X11
display for integration tests.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then we configure two services to be used; the built in postgres service, and
the
beanstalkd service we built. We also set up notifications for every event to the excellent
&lt;a href="http://slack.com">Slack&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next comes the test script. These are just run in sequence we setup bundler
with the cache, create the database, run migrations and then start up the
virtual X11 server. Finally we run the actual tests.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If they succeed, the deploy script is run. Drone supports many deploy scenarios
out of the box, but to get what I wanted, I wrote this little Perl script:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-perl" data-lang="perl">&lt;span style="color:#75715e">#!/usr/bin/env perl&lt;/span>

&lt;p>It sets up the git environment, normalizes the current branch name,

&lt;p>&lt;em>I hate having to log in and write content in the wordpress web app.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To remedy that, I&amp;rsquo;ve switched from Wordpress to Jekyll. Writing markdown straight into vim seems much more likely to happen than posting in the wordpress web editor. In case you are wondering, the theme I&amp;rsquo;m using here is &lt;a href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com">lanyon&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m hosting the thing on github.com with cloudflare in front, because it was really really easy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now let&amp;rsquo;s cross our fingers and hope this isn&amp;rsquo;t the most recent post here next year :-)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>vim plugin for jekyll</title><link>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2014-05-08-vim-plugin-for-jekyll/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 May 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author/><guid>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2014-05-08-vim-plugin-for-jekyll/</guid><description>&lt;p>Just added &lt;a href="https://github.com/csexton/jekyll.vim/">this&lt;/a> vim plugin to my &lt;a href="https://github.com/marcusramberg/dotfiles/blob/master/link/.vimrc">vimrc&lt;/a>, to make it easy to start a new post.

While I agree with most of the listed ones (and in fact &lt;a href="http://marcus.nordaaker.com/moving-to-moose-hackathon-2013/">contributed to the new p5-mop&lt;/a> proposal during the recent Hackathon), I found one feature curiously missing.&lt;/p>
&lt;div>&lt;/div>
&lt;div>I mean, JWZ pointed this out in 1998; &lt;a href="http://www.jwz.org/doc/gc.html">Perl garbage collection is a bad joke&lt;/a>. That was 14 years ago, and the situation is the same. It is trivial to create a circular reference and trip it up. Especially when you are doing evented code where callbacks are common, it is quite easy to close over some variable and create a leak. Languages like C#, Ruby and Java has this sorted already with variants of mark and sweep-based systems, Python has built in cycle detectors in their ref count implementation, and even Objective-C manages to detect cycles fairly well with their new compile-time automated reference counting.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div>
&lt;div>&lt;/div>
&lt;div>&lt;/div>
&lt;div>Don't worry so much about adding sugar to the syntax. This is a feature Perl really needs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div></description></item><item><title>Moving to Moose Hackathon 2012</title><link>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2012-09-01-moving-to-moose-hackathon-2013/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Sep 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author/><guid>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2012-09-01-moving-to-moose-hackathon-2013/</guid><description>&lt;p>This week, my excellent Perl Mongers group Oslo.pm, led by the excellent &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/sjoshuan">Salve&lt;/a>,  has arranged an event we called the Moving to Moose Hackathon 2012. The purpose of this event was to promote the adoption of a MOP (Meta Object Protocol) in Perl development. To this effect, we had two groups, the Perl RDF community, looking to adopt moose in their modules, and &lt;a href="http://search.cpan.org/~stevan/">Stevan Little&lt;/a> and his merry gang of p5-mop developers, looking to create a proposal for a MOP in the Perl core itself, to replace the venerable blessed hash object model.&lt;/p>
&lt;div> &lt;/div>
&lt;div>Unfortunately due to the arrival of baby Milla in June, I was unable to attend the entire event, which started on saturday. Thus I missed the walk to Pulpit Rock (did I mention the event was smack in the middle of the Norwegian fjords?) Luckily I've been there before (see pic on the right :-). I arrived early Tuesday morning by the night train. On the way there, I re-read the proposal for the &lt;a href="https://github.com/stevan/p5-mop">p5-mop&lt;/a>. &lt;/div>
&lt;div> &lt;/div>
&lt;div>&lt;a title="Pulpit Rock by Marcus Ramberg, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marcusramberg/191797791/">&lt;img style="float: right;" src="http://farm1.staticflickr.com/69/191797791_00efdd72b6.jpg" alt="Pulpit Rock" width="336" height="500" />&lt;/a>&lt;/div>
&lt;div> &lt;/div>
&lt;div>Since I'm not a mad hatter scientist like &lt;a href="http://blog.woobling.org/">Yuval&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/doyster">Jesse&lt;/a>, and don't know the Moose MOP that well, I concentrated my efforts on tooling and real world triage of the prototype. For me, the most exciting idea of the proposal is adding first class 'method', 'has' and 'class' keywords, so that you can declare Perl classes like this:&lt;/div>
&lt;div> &lt;/div>
&lt;div>    class Cat (extends =&amp;gt; Animals) {&lt;/div>
&lt;div>      has $claws;&lt;/div>
&lt;div>      method meow { ... }&lt;/div>
&lt;div>    }&lt;/div>
&lt;div> &lt;/div>
&lt;div>Since I'm an avid TextMate fan (specially since the Open Source release this fall), I started by extending the TM2 syntax to support these new keywords. This means getting proper highlighting, as well as easy navigation in classes and methods. You can find my fork of the official Perl syntax highlighter &lt;a href="https://github.com/marcusramberg/perl.tmbundle/tree/p5-mop">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/div>
&lt;div> &lt;/div>
&lt;div>I then started work on porting a few Mojo base classes to the new syntax. Being one of the &lt;a href="http://mojolicio.us/">Mojolicious&lt;/a> core developers, I know these classes rather well, and they have the advantage of being light on dependencies and optimized for easy porting to Perl6, as well as having comprehensive test suites. This made them an ideal target for trying out features of the prototype. &lt;/div>
&lt;div> &lt;/div>
&lt;div>Of course I met some hardship underways. The biggest issue for me during the port was the lack of BUILDARGS, a class method to massage the constructor parameters into a hash, but all in all the experience was quite educational. I also found some small points of improvement in the specifications during my attempts, and submitted a simple doc patch. &lt;/div>
&lt;div> &lt;/div>
&lt;div>Together with Jan Henning, I also looked into the feasibilty of supporting overloading in the new p5-mop classes, and Jan Henning ended up writing a &lt;a href="https://github.com/jhthorsen/p5-mop/tree/mopx-overload">new meta class&lt;/a> to support this. I believe this should be refactored into a meta role when the mop has been updated with support for that.&lt;/div>
&lt;div> &lt;/div>
&lt;div>In the period that I was there, the main p5-mop developers struggled quite a bit with an issue in the dispatching that was giving bizarre errors and was really hard to track down. Unfortunately, this slowed down development, as we were unable to start using the new two-phase bootstrap code which  would allow us much easier development of the meta classes themself. &lt;/div>
&lt;div> &lt;/div>
&lt;div>However, I was really excited about the discussions about the new 'meta' keyword on the last night of the hackathon to allow meta defintions (and thus class methods, and roles) in the class defintions themselves.  I quite look forward to the updated prototype, and hope to resume my port as soon as BUILDARGS support has landed.&lt;/div>
&lt;div> &lt;/div>
&lt;div>I think the crucial question now is if we can manage to maintain velocity in the development of the p5-mop prototype after this hackathon. I truly hope we can start seeing real world usage of it soon. This is the best way to figure out gotchas and problems with the specification before it lands in the core.&lt;/div></description></item><item><title>Debugging LWP with mitmproxy</title><link>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2012-07-12-debugging-lwp-with-mitmproxy/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jul 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author/><guid>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2012-07-12-debugging-lwp-with-mitmproxy/</guid><description>&lt;p>Are you using an LWP app, and trying to debug it?

One simple idea is all you need before your brain&lt;br />
automatically explores problems, solutions, and dreams.&lt;br />
Turning that idea into something tangible and wonderful is harder.&lt;br />
You need structure, strategies, people, hard work.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The software world is young and we are still figuring out the most basic processes of the craft. For instance, we tend to label ourself architects or designers, inspired by people who build houses or work in mass production.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Designers tend to paint pictures, while engineers tend to make diagrams describing what they want to make. Both of these approaches are fundamentally flawed in software. They make a lot of sense in the trades that inspired them, where the cost of change is high and getting it right the first time is essential. Making software is pretty much the opposite.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With software it's so easy to reiterate that there's no need to choose between ideas on the drawing board. You can simply build it and see for yourself how it would work. As long as you always make the &lt;strong>simplest possible version&lt;/strong>, you can quickly verify if it's a good idea or not, and it can be rather efficient too.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I'm not saying that you shouldn't use Photoshop or OmniGraffle in the process of making. They are useful tools for making your software better. Refining it, making sure they play well with others. However, I believe that a lot of the&lt;br />
'design processes' that go on now are flawed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In fact, I would like to remove all labels. Take a big magic marker, cross out 'engineer' or 'designer', and write one word on all of them:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>MAKER&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I sometimes hear people say 'everything is design'. I do agree that everyone who is involved in making software needs to care about what it does, how it works, how it feels, and so on. The problem in my mind is that this definition&lt;br />
makes 'design' too generic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It also tends to exclude programmers and gives the impression that they don't need to care about the look and behaviour of the end result. In my experience, this pattern leads to massive amounts of suck.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Stop thinking about programmers and designers. We're all makers, so don't feel limited by such a poorly placed label. You're job is to &lt;strong>make&lt;/strong> the software. I don't care what hats you wear as long as you're contributing. We should always strive to learn more skills, to become better makers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>People with a classic IT background should learn more about writing, colors and traditional design principles. Those who possess these skills should learn more about markup, CSS, Interface Builder, or maintaining resources in version control systems and project files. The more you know about how software is made, the better you can help making it great.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This does not mean that I advocate design by committee. I do believe all software needs a director; one who maintains the vision of what we are making, and who instructs and directs the rest of the team. This person is ultimately&lt;br />
responsible for the shape of the product. But without good makers, that person is doomed to fail.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Let us all become better makers.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2012-05-01-3657/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 May 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author/><guid>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2012-05-01-3657/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Onion browser - TOR on IOS</title><link>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2012-04-30-onion-browser-tor-on-ios/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Apr 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author/><guid>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2012-04-30-onion-browser-tor-on-ios/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Onion Router is a internet project that aims to anonymize your traffic by routing it through a darknet with various exit points to the Internet.

There has been a dazzling number of releases, 122 in fact, including the current release, 2.42&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some of the releases were mere bugfix releases, with nothing noteworthy to add, but I&amp;#8217;ll try going through the major releases in the last year. When this year started, we already had a robust MVC Web framework, and through the year you will note that a lot of the work has gone into building a first class real time web framework. 2010 ended with 1.0, codename Snow Flake, released 26th of december 2010. 1.01 fixed a couple of bugs, and added TLS Authentication.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The next major release, code name &amp;#8220;Smiling Cat Face With Heart-Shaped Eyes&amp;#8221;, was released on 2011-02-14. This release deprecated wildcard route names in favor of automatically generated default names for all routes. There were several new experimental features, including a more Moose-like attribute generator, on_start attribute for Mojo::Client, support for setting the user agent, mode-specific built-in templates to easily add a production error template, and CSS selectors in the &amp;#8216;get&amp;#8217; command. There were also a new image helper, and support for session cookies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The next major change was in 1.13, which deprecated the ailing Mojo::Client for a much improved Mojo::UserAgent, which handled async requests in a much more coherent fashion.There were also features added like IPV6 support and the default Fail Raptor added in 1.17 and argument localization in 1.18 before 1.3 which was released the 5th of may1.4. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>1.3 was codenamed &amp;#8220;Tropical Drink&amp;#8221;, and tried to deprecate 5.8 support, 5.8 no longer being supported by the Perl core developers, and having serious security issues. However, due to RedHat users with old Perls, we had to temporarily revert that decision, before finally removing 5.8 support in release 2.0; Mojo::Base was also updated to enable 5.10 features. This release also added an experimental &amp;#8220;before_render&amp;#8221; hook and exposed the hooks in Lite apps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>1.4, &amp;#8220;Smiling Face With Sunglasses&amp;#8221;, followed about a month later, 2nd of june, and contained a major update to the Mojo::DOM parser, adding an &amp;#8216;append&amp;#8217; method, direct hash access for attributes, and child element accessor, as well as collections. The release also added an &amp;#8216;eval&amp;#8217; command, improved long poll support and started serializing sessions as JSON, which is more efficient than Storable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Several minor releases followed, including 1.42 allowing status as an argument to render and 1.44 adding &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bbIBs0P2t0">Morbo&lt;/a>, the fearsome restarting development server. (DOOOM) this release also added an application mount plugin. 1.47 included a new callback condition as well as a host condition for the routes. 1.53 added format support to Mojo::Log and 1.57 dramatically improved &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AOfbnGkuGc">Hypnotoad&lt;/a> hot restart, allowing you a hot restart just by running &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AOfbnGkuGc">Hypnotoad&lt;/a> again, as well as adding a &amp;#8212;stop parameter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>1.65 changed the IOLoop to be event based, and added support for using the EV event loop, allowing for great performance and compability with AnyEvent modules. In 1.69, IOLoop::Trigger allowed grouping nonblocking requests easily, and Mojo::DOM added healing support, allowing it to parse most markup that renders in a browser.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To make Mojolicious more RESTish, 1.73 added the experimental respond_to renderer, as well as type detection. 1.78 added a cpanify command and plugin generator to allow easy plugin writing and sharing. 1.80 normalized the casing of plugins, and 1.82 added a grep method to collections, later joined by &amp;#8216;first&amp;#8217;, &amp;#8216;reverse,&amp;#8217;,shuffle&amp;#8217; and &amp;#8216;sort&amp;#8217;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Web socket testing was added in 1.86, 1.87 added an app command and a &amp;#8216;t&amp;#8217; helper, and 1.99 adding group support to Lite apps, as well as binary support for web sockets.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All this as well as several minor features, bugfixes and documentation updates adds up to Mojolicious 2.0, code named &amp;#8220;Leaf Fluttering In Wind&amp;#8221; which was released 17th of october. It also added slice support to collections and completed the transition from callbacks to events. Web socket support was updated to ietf-17. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>2.01 followed two days later, adding upgrade and part events, and 2.03 adding new experimental ietf http status codes. 2.10 added a websocket send_frame method and frame event, 2.19 revised the hook system to use events, and 2.27 was a major streamlining of the core IOLoop, deprecating several methods.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2.29 added chained events from the plugin system, and a new around_dispatch hook. 2.35 added etag support to Mojo Headers, and 2.37 marked the change of Mojolicious to being maintained by a core team, adding me(Marcus Ramberg), Glen Hinkle and Abhijit Menon-Sen to the core. This release also worked around a serious memory leak in Perl itself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2.39 was released just before the holidays, and updated the user agent to use an &amp;#8216;error&amp;#8217; event, as well as exposing &amp;#8216;local_address&amp;#8217; and adding a close method to IOLoop Streams. 2.40 was released on the 24th, adding JSON Pointer support, and finally 2.41 was released on the 28th stabilizing many of the experimental features mentioned above, and allowing session expiry to be turned off.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We now believe the real time part of Mojolicious to be as robust as the MVC part, and expect less frequent releases of the framework in 2012. If you want to learn more about the features in Mojolicious, check out our &lt;a href="http://mojolicio.us/perldoc/Mojolicious/Guides">excellent guides&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I've been a fan of the simplicity and elegance of webOS for a while. I even used BeOS back in it's day. I didn't really like the HP devices tho, and for me this is the optimal outcome. Provided that HP choses a liberal license, this means that webOS might actually get some adoption. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I even belive webOS would make a foundation for a nice Linux based desktop OS (Something Linux desperately needs), if provisions were made for a usable keyboard and touchpad multitouch gestures. Some of the leading internet pundits are less optimistic about this move than I am tho. John Gruber of Daring Fireball &lt;a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/12/09/hp-webos">writes&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>&lt;p>I hope I’m wrong, but I think this is just the difference between putting your dog down and letting it free on a distant mountain road.
&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Matt Gemmel takes it &lt;a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/mattgemmell/rss2/~3/vOQ7reqFIFU/">even further&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>&lt;p> Want to know what happens when you make an operating system open? The same thing as when you leave your car open: sooner or later, it ends up smelling like a urinal.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Which I find a rather ridicolous notion. Certainly, a lot of Open Source apps were made by neckbeards with little or no design skills. However, WebOS is already very well designed, and even contains a nice style guide for apps. Just look how nice this Open Source twitter client for WebOS looks (&lt;a href="https://github.com/rmxdave/phnx">phnx&lt;/a>):&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/rmxdave/phnx">&lt;img src="http://marcus.nordaaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/phnx.png" alt="" title="phnx" width="650" height="480" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3625" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The distinguished interface style is already there, with gui widgets for app developers to use, which makes it more likely that usable and user friendly apps may be developed by an open source community. From running &lt;a href="http://iusethis.com">iusethis.com&lt;/a>, I've noticed that when there's already a defined style like on the mac, there's a better chance of getting well designed open source apps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just look at &lt;a href="http://osx.iusethis.com/hp/quicksilver">QuickSilver&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://osx.iusethis.com/hp/cyberduck">Cyberduck&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://osx.iusethis.com/hp/transmission">Transmission&lt;/a> and even &lt;a href="http://osx.iusethis.com/hp/adium">Adium&lt;/a>, widely used open source mac apps that are far ahead of their equivalent Linux-based apps. Being open source doesn't have to mean design by comittee. It's not like closed source is a guarantee of good design either.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What WebOS does need is improved performance, stability, better apis, and wider availability. The first things are absolutely things that we beardy Unix types are quite good at. Obviously Open Sourcing a codebase also means that professionals from several companies contribute, just look at the kind of boost this has given to Webkit. While on the subject of WebKit, the fact that WebOS apps are made using open web technologies is a very good fit for the open source community as well. Some of us that have been developing for the IOS platform are secretly yearning for a equally good open platform. Android is certainly not it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hopefully Open Sourcing with a liberal license will help with the last point too. I specially see Chinese cell phone producers as likely to pick up this opportunity, but possibly some of the existing android players as well. I'm even hoping there might be a distribution available for the iPad, and as I mentioned earlier, I am hoping to see webOS on prominent Linux distributions in the near future..&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It's not like this is a big closed source platform that is totally alien to the Open Source community. webOS already runs on linux, and uses a lot of the same open source technology we know and love (just check the open source information in the OS to verify this).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hopefully HP will allow the current team to steward the OS forward. In my ideal world they would move the project to github and keep the contribution flow through pull requests where the core team is able to maintain a certain level of control.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If this happens, I see a bright future ahead for WebOS. &lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Visualization of the Mojo class tree.</title><link>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2011-12-04-visualization-of-the-mojo-class-tree/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Dec 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author/><guid>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2011-12-04-visualization-of-the-mojo-class-tree/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://marcus.nordaaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Mojolicious-Classes1.jpg">&lt;img src="http://marcus.nordaaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Mojolicious-Classes1.jpg" alt="" title="Mojolicious Classes" width="806" height="546" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3620" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this visualization, I've tried to group the various Mojo classes by function and color code them. The classes are placed in layers, and related groups are close to each other. Note that I've dropped abstract base classes and Mojolicious related subclasses from this visualization, as well as some servers and all the commands. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>This might be useful as a quick reference, if you want to print it, you can get the PDF &lt;a href="https://github.com/marcusramberg/mojo-classes/blob/master/Mojolicious%20Classes.pdf?raw=true">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I've stuffed the omnigraffle source as well as a pdf and jpeg representation on github, in case someone wants to play with it:&lt;br />

&lt;p>*updated* Was missing Test::Mojo, also made it a bit more symetrical while I was at it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>$ mojo get is X-ray for the web</title><link>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2011-11-30-mojo-get-is-x-ray-for-the-web/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Nov 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author/><guid>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2011-11-30-mojo-get-is-x-ray-for-the-web/</guid><description>&lt;p>Mojolicious isn't just useful for perl coders, it also includes a command line tool that can be quite handy for anybody who wants to get info from the web:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>
usage: /Users/marcus/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.14.2/bin/mojo get [OPTIONS] \
URL [SELECTOR] [COMMANDS]
mojo get /
mojo get mojolicio.us
mojo get -v -r google.com
mojo get --method POST --content 'trololo' mojolicio.us
mojo get --header 'X-Bender: Bite my shiny metal ass!' mojolicio.us
mojo get mojolicio.us 'head &amp;gt; title' text
mojo get mojolicio.us .footer all
mojo get mojolicio.us a attr href
mojo get mojolicio.us '*' attr id
mojo get mojolicio.us 'h1, h2, h3' 3 text
These options are available:
--charset &amp;lt;charset&amp;gt; Charset of HTML5/XML content, defaults to auto
detection or "UTF-8".
--content &amp;lt;content&amp;gt; Content to send with request.
--header &amp;lt;name:value&amp;gt; Additional HTTP header.
--method &amp;lt;method&amp;gt; HTTP method to use, defaults to "GET".
--redirect Follow up to 5 redirects.
--verbose Print verbose debug information to STDERR.&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>First, the name can be a bit awkward when you use it often. I tend to shorten it to 'mg':&lt;/p>
&lt;pre> $ alias mg='mojo get'&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>mg is a command line utility similar to curl, but with some really neat tricks up it's sleeve. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>As you can see from the examples above, mg allows you to use familiar CSS selectors to process the response body. This turns out to be very useful. For instance, to get the links to the frontpaged apps on my site &lt;a href="http://iusethis.com/">iusethis.com&lt;/a>:
&lt;pre>
$ mg -r iusethis.com 'h2 a' attr href
http://osx.iusethis.com/app/corebreach
http://osx.iusethis.com/app/terraray
http://osx.iusethis.com/app/preferencemanager

http://osx.iusethis.com/app/pagelayers
http://osx.iusethis.com/app/arrivalsampdepartures
http://osx.iusethis.com/app/iawriter
&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Check the top one for link tags:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$ mg -r http://osx.iusethis.com/app/corebreach link&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>
&amp;lt;link href="http://osx.iusethis.com/appcast/corebreach" rel="alternate" title="Sparkle AppCast" type="application/rss+xml" /&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;link href="http://osx.iusethis.com/static/opensearch.xml" rel="search" title="iusethis" type="application/opensearchdescription+xml" /&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Neat, an appcast, let's take a look at the version history:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre> $ mg http://osx.iusethis.com/appcast/corebreach title text
Appcast for CoreBreach
CoreBreach 1.1
CoreBreach 1.0.2
CoreBreach 1.0.1
CoreBreach 1.0
&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Mojo understands much more complex queries than these tho. Pretty much anything you can use in jQuery or CSS 3 works.&lt;br />
A good way to find these defintions is to open up your web page with the Chrome debugger:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://osx.iusethis.com/">&lt;img src="http://nordaaker.no/docs/skitch/i_use_this_mac_os_x_software__New_Releases-20111130-005241.jpg"/>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just right-click the element you want to know more about and choose 'Inspect Element' from the menu. This gives you a really simple view of the DOM, which shows you which element on the web page you are highlighting, as well as the parent nodes to your element for use in selectors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As for the last argument, you can call anything that you can call on a &lt;a href="http://mojolicio.us/perldoc/Mojo/DOM">Mojo DOM Node&lt;/a>.&lt;br />
If you exclude it you just get the markup as you saw above.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because the client uses the Mojo UserAgent, it already supports features like HTTPS and basic authentication credentials in the URL.&lt;br />
mojo get also supports features like doing posts and setting headers, as well as setting the method and the request body, but I think it's this DOM queries that puts it apart from the other HTTP clients like curl, wget or lwp-download. Here's a final trick:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Set MOJO_USERAGENT_DEBUG=1 in your environment to get full traces of your HTTP requests.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like it? Installation is really simple and fast. &lt;a href="http://mojolicio.us">Go get it&lt;/a>!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Easily integrating your Mojolicious app with Facebook.</title><link>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2011-01-08-easily-integrating-your-mojolicious-app-with-facebook/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jan 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author/><guid>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2011-01-08-easily-integrating-your-mojolicious-app-with-facebook/</guid><description>&lt;p>Facebook has recently released a&lt;a href="http://graph.facebook.com/"> new Graph API&lt;/a>. It's a simple RESTish API, and uses the newly released OAuth2 spec for authorization. This makes it a great match for &lt;a href="http://mojolicio.us">Mojolicious&lt;/a>, and using my new &lt;a href="https://github.com/marcusramberg/mojolicious-plugin-oauth2">OAuth2&lt;/a> plugin (Also coming to a CPAN mirror near you), it's absolutely trivial.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here is a simple Lite example. Just register an app with facebook to get the key and secret.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>
use Mojolicious::Lite;
# configure the plugin
plugin 'oauth2', facebook => {
key => 'my-key',
secret => 'my-secret' };
get 'hello' => sub {
My $self=shift;
#redirects the gets the token asynchronous
$self->get_token('facebook', callback => sub {
my $token=shift;
my $me=$self->client->get(
'https://graph.facebook.com/me?access_token='.$token)->res->json;
$self->render( text =>
"Hello ".$me->{name} );
});
&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>As you can see, the plugin handles the request flow automatically. We then use the built in JSON parsing in the Mojolicious Client to turn the API data into structures we can work with in our application.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Updating facebook data is just as trivial, you just use post requests with the data you need to update. See http://graph.facebook.com/ for more info on that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you plan to run your app through a standalone daemon such as Hypnotoad (I really think you should :) It could be worth it to rewrite the last section of your app to take advantage of async operations like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>
$self->client->async->get( 'https://graph.facebook.com/me?access_token='.$token, sub {
my $me=shift->res->json;
$self->render( text=>"Hello ".$me->{name} );
})->start;
&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>The async plugin itself also supports an optional async=>1 setting to enable async fetching of the token.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>iPad as a writer' s tool</title><link>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2011-01-01-ipad-as-a-writer-s-tool/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author/><guid>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2011-01-01-ipad-as-a-writer-s-tool/</guid><description>&lt;p>I believe I have found my ideal writing tool. For the last couple of months, I have been drafting text using &lt;a href="http://itunes.apple.com/no/app/ia-writer/id392502056?mt=8">iA Writer&lt;/a> on the iPad. While the softward keyboard is cumbersome to use, I find the focus the combination gives very inspiring. Nothing but me and the text, no IMs or emails to disturb me. I have turned off notifications on the iPad, so not even a ongoing game of &lt;a href="http://itunes.apple.com/no/app/words-with-friends/id322852954?mt=8">Words With Friends&lt;/a> can spoil my productivity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today I was out shopping on Oxford street, and on a whim I picked up the &lt;a href="http://store.apple.com/us/searchresult?p=MC533LL/B&amp;ra=1&amp;r=/us/product/MC533LL/B%3Fmco%3DMTY3ODQ5OTY&amp;t=ipad+keyboard">iPad keyboard dock&lt;/a>. This thing is awesome! It has the required special keys to interact with the iPad's functionality, but otherwise it feels just like Apple's other excellent keyboards. It holds the iPad vertically in just the right angle, and plugs into a power source, as well as external speakers if I need music while I work. In short, I am in love.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I expect this to be my primary writing tool for the near future. If I'm going to nitpick, the only thing I am hoping for is higher DPI on the next generation of iPads so that iA Writer can fit a bit more text per line. One final trick; The keyboard lets you switch between languages with cmd-space. Exactly the same combination I use to switch between norwegian and english keyboard layouts on the mac. Pretty awesome.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My first Mojolicious Plugin - Proxy</title><link>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2010-12-16-my-first-mojolicious-plugin-proxy/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Dec 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author/><guid>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2010-12-16-my-first-mojolicious-plugin-proxy/</guid><description>&lt;p>A few days ago I uploaded my first Mojolicious plugin to CPAN,&lt;a href="http://search.cpan.org/~mramberg/Mojolicious-Plugin-Proxy-0.2/"> Mojolicious::Plugin::Proxy&lt;/a>. My use case was that I am writing a simple single-file html5/javascript app, which needed to access a remote JSON feed. When running on a device with file:/// URLs, cross-site scripting is not an issue, but when running on a web-server, my appis unable to reach that remote JSON feed, so I wrote this plugin to allow me to simply proxy JSON requests from the local server to the remote one. This is how it works&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>    plugin 'proxy';&lt;br />
   get 'ws' =&amp;gt; sub { shift-&amp;gt;proxy_to('http://remote_url', with_query_params=&amp;gt;1);&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>The fact that Mojolicious includes a full async http client made this plugin trivial to implement. The unit tests is almost more code than the module itself.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mozilla Javascript documentation</title><link>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2010-09-28-mozilla-javascript-documentation/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author/><guid>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2010-09-28-mozilla-javascript-documentation/</guid><description>&lt;p>﻿&lt;a title="JavaScript JS Documentation: JS String match, JavaScript String match, JS String .match, JavaScript String .match" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String">&lt;img src="http://static.jsconf.us/promotejsvs.png" alt="JavaScript JS Documentation: JS String match, JavaScript String match, JS String .match, JavaScript String .match" width="160" height="280" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>3 reasons for the lack of updates here lately</title><link>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2010-08-06-3-reasons-for-the-lack-of-updates-here-lately/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Aug 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author/><guid>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2010-08-06-3-reasons-for-the-lack-of-updates-here-lately/</guid><description>&lt;h2>&lt;a href="http://iphone.iusethis.com/app/darknebula-episodetwo"> Dark Nebula Episode 2&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>

To improve performance, we've also added a new caching system, to allow us to cache more data for logged-in users.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>Find your friends&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Looking up your contacts in GMail is a feature that we've wanted for a long time, but we did not want to compromise users by asking for their passwords. Now that Google supports OAuth we were able to implement it the way we wanted. In order to use it, go to your profile and click the 'more' link on the 'friends' sidebar:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img title="i_use_this_mac_os_x_software__applications_used_by_marcus-20100622-095254.png" src="http://nordaaker.com/docs/skitch/i_use_this_mac_os_x_software__applications_used_by_marcus-20100622-095254.png" border="0" alt="i_use_this_mac_os_x_software__applications_used_by_marcus-20100622-095254.png" />&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once There, click on this sidebar:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The system asks you to grant iusethis permission to access your address book data, choose the google account you use:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img title="Google_Accounts-20100622-102953.png" src="http://nordaaker.com/docs/skitch/Google_Accounts-20100622-102953.png" border="0" alt="Google_Accounts-20100622-102953.png" />&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then we will present you with a list of contacts who have accounts on iusethis. Just press the 'follow' link to add them.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2>Messaging&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You can now contact users on iusethis directly. To do this, go to the user's profile, and click the contact link:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img title="i_use_this_mac_os_x_software__Recent_comments_by_rob-20100622-103404.png" src="http://nordaaker.com/docs/skitch/i_use_this_mac_os_x_software__Recent_comments_by_rob-20100622-103404.png" border="0" alt="i_use_this_mac_os_x_software__Recent_comments_by_rob-20100622-103404.png" />&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then just write your message and click 'Send'. Just like everywhere else on iusethis, you can use textile formatting in your message. The message will be delivered to the user as a normal email, with your registered email address as the 'From' address, so that he can easily respond to your message.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img title="i_use_this_mac_os_x_software__software_for_the_osx_population-20100622-103530.png" src="http://nordaaker.com/docs/skitch/i_use_this_mac_os_x_software__software_for_the_osx_population-20100622-103530.png" border="0" alt="i_use_this_mac_os_x_software__software_for_the_osx_population-20100622-103530.png" />&lt;/p>

&lt;h2>Replies&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>@username replies has been a defacto convention on iusethis for a long time, and we've already been doing things like linking to users automatically, but now we actually support links back to the comment you're responding to. This also means that each comment has it's own permanent page:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>For consistency we are now using relative timestamps for dates everywhere, and the dates act as permalinks. By default, we will assume you are responding to the latest comment by this user on the app you're commenting on, but if you want to reply to a specific comment, you can use the 'reply to comment' link on the comment permalink page. We also took the opportunity to streamline the user comments page to be more like the main recent comments list:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img title="i_use_this_mac_os_x_software__Recent_comments_by_brh-20100622-142656.png" src="http://nordaaker.com/docs/skitch/i_use_this_mac_os_x_software__Recent_comments_by_brh-20100622-142656.png" border="0" alt="i_use_this_mac_os_x_software__Recent_comments_by_brh-20100622-142656.png" />&lt;/p>

This huge, wonderful library of Perl code usually helps me avoid reinventing any wheels. On the other hand, the standard CPAN client is one of my most regular hate objects when coding Perl.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It's not that it lacks any features I need, rather the opposite, the damn thing has a million options, and no good defaults. CPANPLUS is only adding to this mess with even more options. However, now there's a better solution.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Check out miyagawa's new CPAN client &lt;a href="http://github.com/miyagawa/cpanminus">cpanminus&lt;/a>. And when I say check out, I mean it literally. Get it from github so you won't have to bother configuring the default cpan shell again:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&amp;nbsp;$ git clone&amp;nbsp;git://github.com/miyagawa/cpanminus.git&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You might want to use one of the tagged releases&amp;nbsp;rather than master tho. Install it in the regular way (&lt;em>perl Makefile.PL &amp;amp;&amp;amp; make install&lt;/em>) and you're good to go. Using it is a breeze:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Command-Central:cpanminus marcus$ cpanm Mojo&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Fetching http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/K/KR/KRAIH/Mojolicious-0.999921.tar.gz&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Building and testing Mojolicious-0.999921 for Mojo...&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Mojo installed successfully.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>cpanminus gives you all the information you want and nothing more, and it asks no questions.

to youtube
21:14 &lt; @marcus> and only pics to facebook
21:15 &lt; @marcus> awesome!
21:15 &lt; @marcus> it's a 12mpixel camera tho
21:15 &lt; @marcus> with 5x optic zoom
21:15 &lt; @marcus> heh, this thing has face recognition
21:15 &lt; @marcus> and a decent flash
21:15 &lt; @marcus> and 720p video
21:16 &lt; @marcus> if the software wasn't so horrible, it'd be awesome
21:16 &lt; @marcus> 3.5" touch screen
21:17 &lt; @marcus> it's got a gps and wifi
21:17 &lt; @marcus> WTF

This module works by evaling everything from the use line as JavaScript. Of course, now you're mixing two languages in one file, which is not going to make any of your syntax validators happy. However, loading it like this will please both perl and jslint:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>
m| /* |; # Comment out JavaScript
use Test::JavaScript::More;
__END__ = ''; // It's is all JS from here. */
ok(1,'Success!');

Me</title><link>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2009-09-29-introducing-me/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Sep 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author/><guid>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2009-09-29-introducing-me/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hey there, the internet is a turbulent place, and since I&amp;#8217;ve moved around quite&lt;br />
a few times, I think I forgot to introduce myself the last time I made the&lt;br />
move. I am Marcus Ramberg, the writer of this blog, and director of&lt;br />
Nordaaker, a small British/Norwegian company currently run out of Oslo,&lt;br />
Norway. In addition to being my personal blog, at the time being this blog&lt;br />
acts as Nordaaker&amp;#8217;s dynamic english presence. As the other director of&lt;br />
Nordaaker, Arne Fismen runs our &lt;a href="http://arne.nordaaker.com/">norwegian presence&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In one form or another, I&amp;#8217;ve been writing on the internet since around&lt;br />
2002, when I set up my first own domain, &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20021106102053/http://thefeed.no/">thefeed.no&lt;/a>.&lt;br />
Back then I was running my own &lt;a href="http://www.movabletype.com/">Movabletype&lt;/a> installation.&lt;br />
Thanks to the glorious &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/">Internet Archive&lt;/a> you can see my&lt;br />
&lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030207101435/thefeed.no/marcus/">first blog&lt;/a> the way it looked about a year after it&amp;#8217;s launch. It is&lt;br />
very strange for me to go back and read the thoughts I had so many years&lt;br />
ago.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was also hosting other blogs on my movabletype installation, including&lt;br />
&lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030604224909/thefeed.no/slemmen/">slemmen&lt;/a>, who wrote about sysadmin stuff and some college friends like&lt;br />
&lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030514183347/thefeed.no/marlboro/archives/2002_12.html">marlboro&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030810191404/thefeed.no/gry/archives/000308.html">gry&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030529184838/thefeed.no/">front page&lt;/a> we had a perl script that aggregated all the blogs,&lt;br />
a simple planet if you will. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Back then, I wrote a lot less about tech than I do now. Looking at the&lt;br />
categories, we see that the three biggest ones are Travel[44], Geek[36]&lt;br />
and Opinion[26]. Still, even then I was journaling things from the&lt;br />
&lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030512092014/thefeed.no/marcus/archives/cat_perl.html">Perl Community&lt;/a>. However, checking back around 2005, a few years&lt;br />
later, Geek[108] was dominant, With Opinion[49] and Mac[34] as the next&lt;br />
ones. Perl is trailing 4. with 27 posts. I also wrote &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041209060055/http://thefeed.no/marcus/archives/cat_books.html">18 book reviews&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>About that time I gave my first &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041212151353/thefeed.no/marcus/archives/cat_perl.html">talk about a MVC framework&lt;/a>.I was&lt;br />
already active in the community, contributing a Mason view to Maypole,&lt;br />
my third CPAN module. I had been using Mason at work for a couple of years&lt;br />
by then. It was not until I started working for ABC Startsiden that I started&lt;br />
using Template Toolkit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>About then, disaster struck. My server HDD died, losing a lot of images&lt;br />
from our image galleries. After that, I lost a lot of the motivation for&lt;br />
running thefeed, given the risks. Losing people&amp;#8217;s personal data isn&amp;#8217;t fun.&lt;br />
At least I am glad that the blogs are preserved in the internet archive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It took a while for me to start writing again after that, but in the period 2006-2009&lt;br />
I decided to use hosted solutions, keeping both a &lt;a href="http://thefeed.vox.com/">vox blog&lt;/a> and a&lt;br />
&lt;a href="http://marcusramberg.livejournal.com/">livejournal&lt;/a>, before finally moving to this blog installation.&lt;br />
I&amp;#8217;m self-hosted again, and the software might vary, but I hope the addresses&lt;br />
will last for a long time :)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Masters of the hipster-universe</title><link>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2009-09-28-masters-of-the-hipster-universe/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Sep 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author/><guid>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2009-09-28-masters-of-the-hipster-universe/</guid><description>&lt;p>Awesome hipster He-Man and friends drawings.

I plan to&lt;br />
do a series on extensions that I've found useful recently. To kick it off,&lt;br />
I'll feature a model which gives me a simple and useful admin interface to&lt;br />
my DBIx::Class models.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I first got involved with MVC Web Frameworks like Maypole and Ruby on&lt;br />
Rails, a big selling point was the ability to generate CRUD (Create/Read/&lt;br />
Update/Delete) interfaces to your data model. Ruby on Rails does this through&lt;br />
a mechanism called scaffolding, where it adds a set of actions to your&lt;br />
controller. It soon became apparent that these CRUD frameworks did not live&lt;br />
up to their promise as a base for creating your own custom actions. Usually,&lt;br />
you spend more time customizing these controllers than you would just&lt;br />
implementing the features you require.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, there is still a good use for these for giving your admins a&lt;br />
direct interface to your data model. There has been several iterations of&lt;br />
these tools for the Catalyst framework, but with Catalyst::Plugin::AutoCRUD,&lt;br />
I've finally found something easy to plug into your existing app, which&lt;br />
integrates well with most setups.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://marcus.nordaaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/autocrud.png" alt="autocrud" title="autocrud" width="500" height="306" class="size-full wp-image-2942" />&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For most apps, all you need to do is plug it into the main application class&lt;br />
by adding AutoCRUD to your list of plugins. This will plug a complete CRUD&lt;br />
application, including controllers and view and templates into your app.&lt;br />
By default it will attach itself at '/autocrud', but you can easily change&lt;br />
that in config. Just add this to your config file:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;plugin ::AutoCRUD>
basepath admin
&lt;/plugin>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>and it will respond to /admin/* instead. Another common requirement is to&lt;br />
add authentication for the admin interface. One way to accomplish that is&lt;br />
by using Catalyst's auto handler functionality. Add a method like this in&lt;br />
your Root controller&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>sub auto :Private {
my ( $self, $c ) = @_;
if ($c->action->reverse =~ /^autocrud\//) {
$c->authenticate({},'users');
}
return 1;
}&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Note that my example is using HTTP Basic auth. The actual authenticate call&lt;br />
needs to be customized for your realm.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>AutoCRUD supports multiple DBIC Schemas, and if will automatically provide you&lt;br />
with a list to let you pick which one to work with. After that, you choose&lt;br />
a Result class, and you have access to an extensive AJAX-enhanched database&lt;br />
admin tool. You can search and browse data, as well as edit it and add new&lt;br />
rows easily. AutoCRUD also understands your DBIC relationships, so you can&lt;br />
easily see data related to the current rows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like it's predecessors, I do not recommend trying to make this tool&lt;br />
into a generic 'allweb'-application. However, if you use it for what it is,&lt;br />
you can save countless of development hours making trivial admin tools. Since&lt;br />
it works again your DBIC Schema, you'll also get the advantage of keeping&lt;br />
your business logic in the data model. Things like DBIC timestamps will&lt;br />
Just Work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>There still might be some polishing left to do on AutoCRUD, but I already&lt;br />
find it a hugely useful tool. You can install it just like you would any other CPAN module using &lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>$ cpan Catalyst::Plugin::AutoCRUD&lt;/code>&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SD available for general use</title><link>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2009-08-27-sd-available-for-general-use/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Aug 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author/><guid>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2009-08-27-sd-available-for-general-use/</guid><description>&lt;p>Jesse Vincent of RT and Hiveminder fame has just announced that his new system SD is available for public use.&lt;/p>

While I've come around to agree with his first point, that Catalyst should generate a reusable config class for the user, I'm not so sure with regards to his model viewpoints.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For me, the strength of Catalyst's Model layer has always been the immense glue layer that allows me to configure any model in a predictable way. Much like DBI gives me a unified way to talk to databases, the Catalyst model-layer gives us a unified way of configuring models. In addition, we are able to provide helpers to create these models from the command line, reducing the work needed to set up a new model.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I will grant Dave that the API for the model adapters could be better. It is my hope that we will accomplish as Catalyst takes advantage of more of the new stack that Moose provides. In particular I am excited about the work Devin Austin is doing for GSOC on&lt;a href="http://www.codedright.net/2009/06/a-technical-report-of-my-gsoc-statusprogress.html"> improving the -Devel package&lt;/a>. This is an area where we can significally improve without too much worry about backwards compability. For instance, the KiokuDB model already uses moose accessors for config.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dave's example only limits itself to talking to a SQL store via DBIx::Class. However, real world applications typically have several models. In some of my apps I talk to S3, or Queue servers, or LDAP stores for user management. This shows the true power of the Catalyst model layer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also hope that we can provide a different way to tie models to controllers. This should be part of the moosify branch of Catalyst-Runtime. I disagree that $schema->resultset('Person') is a significant improvement on $c->model('DBIC::Person'). Controller code is not meant to run without a context anyways. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I hope that by looking at Moose Extensions, we will be able to find a more suitable API for this functionality. Of course, we have a lot of work ahead of us, but I am really starting to like what Catalyst has turned into.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Putting your favorite apps on your blog</title><link>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2009-08-07-putting-your-favorite-apps-on-your-blog/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Aug 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author/><guid>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2009-08-07-putting-your-favorite-apps-on-your-blog/</guid><description>&lt;p>In this article I will show you how you can add a sidebar-item with your favorite apps to your favorite blog template.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>3D with HTML5 Canvas series</title><link>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2009-08-06-3d-with-html5-canvas-series/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Aug 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author/><guid>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2009-08-06-3d-with-html5-canvas-series/</guid><description>&lt;p>Mr Speaker is doing a series of posts on how to do 3d graphics with the HTML 5 Canvas:&lt;/p>

One of his big gripes is related to the space the tabbar uses:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>&lt;p>When I made the decision, my thinking was that the application had four separate features, so it only made sense to separate them using the tab bar. What I found as I got further into the development of the application was that the bottom tab bar was incredibly limiting for where to place extra controls.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The main problem here is that by default a Tab Bar is visible in all views of the application. I much prefer &lt;a href="http://iphone.iusethis.com/app/tweetie">Tweetie&lt;/a>'s implementation, where the tab bar is only visible on list views, and pushed away on the detail views. Of course, this layout is actively discouraged by Apple, who recommend you put your navigation controller *inside* each tab bar. They do it the opposite way themselves in itunes tho. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, the interaction allowed by the Tab bar is really limited. You cannot easily disable and enable a tab, for instance. Still, I believe this way of presenting data has merit, specially in giving non-technical users a clear overview of the main parts of your application.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>*update*&lt;/em> As Ross Boucher &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/boucher/status/2552630433">points out&lt;/a> you can also hide the Tab Bar by setting the "hidesBottomBarWhenPushed" property on your controllers. An important gotcha with this is to make sure you only set it on the first level controllers.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>2008: A year of OSM edits</title><link>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2009-06-29-2008-a-year-of-osm-edits/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jun 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author/><guid>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2009-06-29-2008-a-year-of-osm-edits/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;object width="400" height="300">&lt;param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" />&lt;param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" />&lt;param name="movie" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=2598878&amp;amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;amp;show_title=1&amp;amp;show_byline=1&amp;amp;show_portrait=0&amp;amp;color=&amp;amp;fullscreen=1" />&lt;embed src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=2598878&amp;amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;amp;show_title=1&amp;amp;show_byline=1&amp;amp;show_portrait=0&amp;amp;color=&amp;amp;fullscreen=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" width="400" height="300">&lt;/embed>&lt;/object>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;block -quote>It turns out that in 85 percent of such personifications, whether a male or female figure is chosen is predicted by the grammatical gender of the word in the artist's native language.

I have been working on setting up a second frontend web node for iusethis.com, as well as rebuilding my development environment after upgrading my laptop to snow leopard (XS modules seems to be broken on that environment for now, so I'm developing in a vmware ubuntu image instead).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most of this time has been spent watching my various systems running test after test of CPAN modules, which has made me realize two things. 1. CPAN has a huge number of tests, some of them very time consuming and 2. End users don't really need to run all these tests.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All they care about is getting the module installed and in working order, which means most of the time, all they need is for their module to run 00use.t to check that the modules can be loaded. I understand the need of CPAN authors to get their tests run on different platforms and perl versions, however, Perl has a very comprehensive smoker setup that handles this. There is no need to force this upon the end user as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Luckily, there is a solution. I was discussing this problem on IRC with Bingos, one of the biggest smokers out there, and he found this:&lt;/p>

As you probably know, the Perl bundle supports validating your perl syntax with a quick shortcut. However, I picked up a quick tip from the "Javascript Tools" bundle. If you rebind the command as ⌘-S, TextMate will automatically check your syntax every time you save a Perl file. In case you need help doing this:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the menu Go to Bundles -> Bundle Editor -> Show Bundle Editor&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Open the Perl Bundle, Click 'Validate syntax', and from there you can easily rebind the key as shown below.&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>&lt;p>Simply, it is a tool that lets you monitor a few key stats from one or more varnish boxes in real-time, from the command line, in a top-like screen.

&lt;blockquote>&lt;p>
This means that you have to live with the same limitations of SQL queries (the fact that they are non recursive, so they can't express transitive relationships), but you don't get the freedom to write queries ad hoc and have them execute efficiently (ad hoc views are supported, but there are no general purposes indexes).

&lt;p>This is in fact one of the reasons I prefer working in smaller more agile shops. Apparently, I'm not alone in disliking enterprise software. Software AG's "Chief Strategist" Miko Matsumura sums it up well:&lt;/p>

Working with Enterprise Software feels a bit like walking through an industrial landfill or an airport hangar. Nothing is built to human scale.

So worn out. Somehow they acknowledge that python is a nice language tho. So why has nobody heard from us in a while? Matt has a theory.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>&lt;p>But here's my point: Perl people hang out on mailing lists. We bottom post, carefully interleaved, with 76 character lines. We have signatures that meet the McQ standard for acceptable size. We hang out on IRC servers and bitch, moan, interact and collaborate with the aid of an 80x25 xterm with irssi, BitchX or IrcII in it[3]. Sometimes we sit at home with a beer and do one or more of the above. Forums? Meh. Those are the things the PHPtards like because they can't figure out how to work a mailing list, right? Blogs? That's not even a fucking word! I mean, in my day, we posted to usenet using Larry Wall's rn that didn't even have decent fucking threading, and we schlepped the posts about from one bnews spool to another over 1200 baud dialup links, and we liked it!&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Obviously, those pesky kids never read our mailing lists ;) Luckily, Matt also has a plan. Join up to the &lt;em>Enlightened Perl: Blogging Iron Man&lt;/em> competition now and show what you are made of! We can do it, yes we can :) And if we are really good, we'll get to see Matt talk about why he loves bunnies with his hair dyed baby pink!

&lt;blockquote>&lt;p>Having been annoyed enough by this sort of POD wrangling already, theorbtwo came up with Pod::Inherit to help the module writers improve their documentation.

&lt;p>I think this is pretty awesome. Thanks to multiple inheritance, mixins, and most recently Moose roles, finding out what methods a given Class provides can sometimes be quite tricky.

&lt;p>This is usually good enough for most people. Using a block eval, you can catch the error and deal with it, even doing a regular expression against it to handle different errors. Still, some people have been writing CPAN modules to add this functionality to the language. Unfortunately, up until now these attempts has mostly fallen into two categories; 'cludgy addon', and 'source filter powered'. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>With some determination, and thanks to recent industrial power tools like &lt;a href="http://search.cpan.org/~vpit/Variable-Magic/lib/Variable/Magic.pm">Variable::Magic&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://search.cpan.org/~flora/B-Hooks-EndOfScope/lib/B/Hooks/EndOfScope.pm">B::Hooks::EndOfScope&lt;/a> &lt;a href="http://search.cpan.org/~ash/">Ash Berlin&lt;/a> has been able to put together a first class try / catch mechanism without using source filters. Check out the &lt;a href="http://search.cpan.org/~ash/TryCatch/lib/TryCatch.pm">TryCatch synopsis from CPAN&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>
&lt;pre>
sub foo {
try {
die SomeClass->new(code=>404) if $notfound;
return "return value from foo";
}
catch (Some::Class $e where { $_->code > 100 } ) {
}
}&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As you see, you can specify types of objects to handle, and this mechanism supports receiving Moose type constraints, including complex MooseX::Types constructs like '&lt;code>Dict[code => Int]&lt;/code>'. It's also quite useful that you can return out of the function from inside a try block, unlike an eval, with just returns from the eval block.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you want to try it yourself, just do $ cpan TryCatch and start playing. The docs are a bit sparse at the moment, but it's easy enough to figure out. Expect the docs to be improved quite soon. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I believe modules like this and &lt;a href="http://search.cpan.org/~flora/MooseX-Declare-0.09/lib/MooseX/Declare.pm">MooseX::Declare&lt;/a> represent a new trend in Perl 5, where CPAN authors extend the syntax of Perl itself using Perl. It'll be interesting to see what turns up in this space in the coming months.

&lt;p>I don’t buy it. In fact, I’m pretty sure that the omission of vanity URLs on Facebook is an intentional design decision from the beginning, and one that I’ve learned to appreciate over time.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I think this change is another result of Facebook's apparent fear and envy of twitter's recent popularity.

&lt;blockquote>&lt;p>That model works well for Linux. Maybe. I'll presume it does. Git eases the pain points expressed by Andrew Morton, the maintainer of the -mm tree, in this message entitled "This Just Isn't Working Any More"&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In short, it makes siloing easier.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>My immediate reaction to reading his post was to think of the old saying ‹‹Guns don't kill people, people kill people››. In fact, my experiences with forks so far has been two cases of forking repos on github, and doing a pull request to the author when my fixes were fit to be included in the main distribution. In both cases the authors included my changes in their versions. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just because there exists a lot of works-in-progress doesn't mean that they represent different authoritative versions of a given module. The situation for the rails OAuth plugin might be a bit muddled, but thanks to github's excellent &lt;a href="http://github.com/pelle/oauth/network">network map&lt;/a>, it's easy to track all of the 12 forks on github (substansially less than 27), out of which most seems to have merged into a new mainline. &lt;/p>
&lt;div class="thumbnail">&lt;a href="http://skitch.com/marcus/b8m6u/the-oauth-network-github">&lt;img src="http://img.skitch.com/20090309-mkhcj5xqeiig2sn7hepshsy79a.preview.jpg" alt="The oauth Network - GitHub" />&lt;/a>&lt;/div>
&lt;p>It is clear that this project suffers from a inactive maintainer, but I believe that Git forks has lowered the barrier to contributing substantially, thus ensuring vitality for open source software projects. Our own Catalyst OAuth support, which resides in SVN is still non-working, despite several promises from people to look into it. These people might have working support in their local applications, but if that is the case, I'm unable to get to them or merge it into the started efforts in Catalyst SVN.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To summarize, Git lowers the barrier to contribution. Building or avoiding silos is up to the software maintainers, and giving support for patched versions is madness any way we look at it. Just the same way as developers are on their own when they use development versions of software, they can't expect support for forked versions of that software either. If you live on the bleeding edge, you are going to bleed a little.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Monkey Island I remade as a Flash Movie</title><link>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2009-03-09-monkey-island-i-remade-as-a-flash-movie/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Mar 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author/><guid>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2009-03-09-monkey-island-i-remade-as-a-flash-movie/</guid><description>&lt;p>Forgot some of the plot details of this classic adventure game?

It's apparently useful for this, with an easily definable syntax, and fairly simple to understand for the en user. However, one factor that could hamper the adoption of JSON is the lack of comment support. This is a really strange omission. After all at JSON is really just a Javascript data structure, and JavaScript does support both the // and /* comment */ style. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>In any user-editable text, comments is useful both to explain sections, and to temporarily disable a section. I've been looking for a new generic data structure representation to replace YAML, and JSON seemed like a really promising candidate, until I found out about this limitation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>*Update: The plot thickens. According to the JSON &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">Wikipedia Page&lt;/a>, the JSON spec used to include support for /* comments */ (c-style). Seems they changed it. Conveniently, this helps to make JSON a YAML subset. I'm pretty sure it is not worth that tho. Anyone have a link on the process that resulted in this?*&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Some positive Catalyst-feedback</title><link>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2009-03-06-some-positive-catalyst-feedback/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Mar 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author/><guid>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2009-03-06-some-positive-catalyst-feedback/</guid><description>&lt;p>Chintana Wilamuna has recently tried out Catalyst for the &lt;a href="http://engwar.com/post/93">Perl StockTrader&lt;/a> client:&lt;/p>

I figured maybe I needed to sign up with a new account on linkshare, so I try that, is redirected to a newer signup form, and after registration, is just landed on the regular linkshare homepage.

&lt;blockquote>&lt;p>When you put it all together, the story become clear: an outsider makes one edit to add a chunk of information, then insiders make several edits tweaking and reformatting it. In addition, insiders rack up thousands of edits doing things like changing the name of a category across the entire site — the kind of thing only insiders deeply care about. As a result, insiders account for the vast majority of the edits. But it’s the outsiders who provide nearly all of the content.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I think this enforces the idea that any good user driven site requires both good gardeners, and a mass of casual contributors who aren't experts in the workings of the site, but contributes with some factoids that works as seeding for good content. We see the same trend on &lt;a href="http://osx.iusethis.com/">iusethis&lt;/a>, where some user creates an app entry, which is improved upon by others, and maintained by the group as a whole. I still believe we have some way to go in clarifying and giving power to the site gardeners tho, at the moment, we do too much of this work.

&lt;p>I believe that with the current race to improve javascript performance, JS stands a good chance of being the language to use both on the server and the client in the near future. It is interesting to read about Google's motivations, since they are somewhat on both sides of the table on this issue. It's just as important to them that other browsers improve their JS runtime as that Chrome does it, in order to support their JS heavy applications like GMail and Google Reader. &lt;/p></description></item><item><title>iPhone sync for linux</title><link>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2009-02-25-iphone-sync-for-linux/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author/><guid>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2009-02-25-iphone-sync-for-linux/</guid><description>&lt;p>With the newer iPhone/iPod firmware, Apple has been doing their best to lock out the Linux people and other 3. parties that want to modify the iPhone database. Of course, these crafty hackers did not take it lying down, but have figured out a way around this. Come on Apple, you already know DRM doesn't work, don't you? I figured that was why you want out of it on the iTunes store. Why bother continuing the fight on the devices? You'll only be humiliated again and again. These people have sufficient motivation to find a way around your obfuscation schemes.

We currently run it using the Russian web server &lt;a href="http://wiki.codemongers.com/Main">Nginx&lt;/a> and standalone fastcgi servers. I am using the Moose based &lt;a href="http://search.cpan.org/~stevan/FCGI-Engine-0.06/">CGI::Engine&lt;/a> distribution by Stevan Little to start the servers. This module makes it really easy to manage your applications. You just create a YML config file like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>
---
- name: "iusethis-osx.server"
nproc: 4
scriptname: "/www/iusethis-osx/script/iusethis_fastcgi.pl"
pidfile: "/var/run/iusethis-osx.pid"
socket: "/var/run/iusethis-osx.sock"
&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>with an entry for each server you want to run. (Note that the paths has been changed to protect the innocent.) Then you just create a simple perl script (See the &lt;a href="http://search.cpan.org/~stevan/FCGI-Engine-0.06/lib/FCGI/Engine/Manager.pm">FCGI::Engine::Manager SYNOPSIS&lt;/a> for a sample), and you can easily start, stop and check the status for each application individually or every application in your config. If you have a system v style init, you can just stick the script in /etc/init.d/ and it will behave just like any of your other startup scripts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is one annoying detail. Each time you roll out code, you have to restart your fastcgi processes. Since Catalyst takes some time to initialize, the application is down, and end users gets 500 Internal Server Error responses, unless you have a load balancer in front and take the node out of the cluster before upgrading. It does not have to work like this. Since the fcgi workers use a non-exclusive lock on the socket, you can start a new set of processes before you kill the old ones. this way, no requests are lost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I really wanted this feature, so I have spent some time today hacking on FCGI::Engine. Stevan accepted my patches, and released version &lt;a href="http://search.cpan.org/~stevan/FCGI-Engine-0.06/">0.06&lt;/a>, which supports this restart mode, via a new 'graceful' method added to FCGI::Engine::Manager + some bug fixes. Nginx already support &lt;a href="http://wiki.codemongers.com/NginxCommandLine#utnbotf">On the fly upgrades&lt;/a>, which means there is no need for us to drop a user connection when rolling out new code again.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Carnivals around the world</title><link>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2009-02-23-carnivals-around-the-world/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author/><guid>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2009-02-23-carnivals-around-the-world/</guid><description>&lt;p>These awesome, burlesque pictures from &lt;a href="http://boston.com/bigpicture/">Big Picture&lt;/a> makes me want to order a plane ride to Brazil right now.

It just takes too long to switch between them, so I've mostly left it at google, and hoped it would be smart enough to understand what I mean. However, with linkhack, it just proxies through to google most of the time, but understands keywords such as 'imdb' to do a movie search, or 'img' to do a image search. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I'm quite pleased that they are using &lt;a href="http://iusethis.com/">iusethis&lt;/a> to 'get' an application as well (try 'get firefox', for instance). I can't help but think that this maybe should be implemented in the browser itself rather than as a web application, but it's definitively an interesting concept. one thing that worries me is if I'll be wanting to google those magic keywords some times. Of course, you can always prefix queries with "google".&lt;/p>

Now you can. simply add 'pwn' to the hostname in the url. &lt;a href="http://pwnyoutube.com">pwnyoutube.com&lt;/a> provides both flv and mpeg4 downloads (when available from youtube). If you prefer, you can also use a bookmarklet. Using this service, I have added a download link to all youtube videos on our video bookmarking service &lt;a href="http://iwatchthis.com/">iwatchthis&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I find it interesting that streaming copyrighted material seems more acceptable to old media than straight downloads. This seems to stem from some deep misunderstanding about it being possible to restrict what you are able to do with media while still letting you play it back on your own system. This is just as wrong for streaming as it has been for every encryption-based scheme they've tried up until now. I'm guessing it won't be long until you get a 'save from spotify' utility as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The history of this has been failure upon failure. First DVD encryption, then DRM and lately, whatever failure Blueray brought with it. It just doesn't work, and given enough initiative, it gets broken. Actually, it requires a lot less effort to break these schemes than it takes to device them, which is a pretty clear indication that they are fighting reality. Wanting it to be otherwise does not change that, and scaring consumers into submission with legal threats won't work either. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I assume that is the same misunderstanding that made content owners allow so much content on Hulu. They think that they can restrict the viewers usage of the material to that format closely, and avoid competing with their existing dying markets. Guess &lt;a href="http://blog.hulu.com/2009/2/18/doing-hard-things">Boxee&lt;/a> came as a nasty shock to them. Hope nobody told them that foreigners watch it through US proxies as well. They are probably old men, and it could give them a heart attack...&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is a wealth of content out there, and the sooner content owners start focus on winning over customers with quality and convenience, rather than to try to force them into bondage with DRM and geographical restrictions, the sooner they will have a chance against the file sharers. I always found it amusing that the only people who are forced to watch those ghastly "You wouldn't steal a car" ads are the ones that actually buy DVDs. Pirates just edit it out. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>People don't mind paying for content, as long as the price is reasonable, and they feel like they are being rewarded rather than punished for it.&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2009-02-20-992/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author/><guid>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2009-02-20-992/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://www.sinfest.net/comikaze/comics/2009-02-20.gif"/>&lt;/p>

They are not interested in openness or right or wrong, good or evil. Apple has only one interest, and that is generating more revenue for Apple. In fact, their attitude casts doubts on Google's "Do no evil" policy merely by their close association to Apple.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Clearly, &lt;a href="http://i.gizmodo.com/5144751/crackulous-allows-for-app-store-piracy">Crackulous&lt;/a> put Apple in a difficult position, and this is their attempt at solving it with one great swipe of the DMCA-Axe. If given the oportunity to dominate, I believe Apple will do much more evil than Microsoft ever did. &lt;/p>

Dan points out the fallacy of having to make too many choices when adopting a new framework. I disagree that that is a deciding factor in Rails or django having more web applications listed on appliedstack than Catalyst. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I believe the extreme Rails hyping and number of books coming out to be a critical Rails success factor, and Google choosing Django as it's only language for App Engine to be a critical Django one. Having said that, I do believe that having to make all of these choices up front, while learning a new framework, has been harmful to Catalyst adoption. I don't think we need to give up flexibility to fix that problem tho. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>We just need to provide good defaults. I shouldn't have to deal with choosing a template system until I've used TT for a while and decided that it sucks. I shouldn't have to decide what the best way for me to talk the database unless I have some legacy model I need to integrate with. I specially don't need to configure a wealth of Authentication modules unless I'm doing something zany. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ranting about this is easy, but I'd like to do something more, so I've created a IRC channel, #catalyst-stacked on irc.perl.org, if you are interested in helping to build a full stack framework on top of Catalyst, come by there and join in on the discussion. &lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Problems with star ratings</title><link>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2009-02-14-problems-with-star-ratings/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author/><guid>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2009-02-14-problems-with-star-ratings/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://stevenf.tumblr.com/">Steven Frank&lt;/a> points to some of the issues with star ratings.

&lt;p>On think that I absolutely agree with but find it hard to sell in to clients is the 'do not estimate' policy.

Today I finally found some &lt;a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl5/index.cgi?tuit">tuits&lt;/a>, and Just Fucking Did It. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Turns out that with a couple of javascript libraries, it was surprisingly easy. Step one was the &lt;a href="http://www.openjs.com/scripts/events/keyboard_shortcuts/">keyboard shortcuts&lt;/a> library, which let you hook up to keyboard input in this simple fashion:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre> shortcut('up',function() {
alert('Lucy in the sky with diamonds');
})&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>However, rather than bore you further you with Beatles lyrics, I hooked it up to the excellent &lt;a href="http://flesler.blogspot.com/2007/10/jqueryscrollto.html">scrollTo&lt;/a> jQuery extension, which lets you smoothly scroll to any anchor in in the page (I added anchors into the video item for convenience):&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>
$.scrollTo('#item_'+num, 313); // Donald number of miliseconds
&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>I also used the URLs from the pager to allow left and right arrows to go to the next/previous page, if those links exist. (This is a simple matter of setting window.location).&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>shortcut("left",function() {
var elem=$('.pager .prev');
if (elem[0]) { window.location=elem.attr('href'); }
});&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>That was easy, but one issue still remained. Whenever you click inside a flash area (which most videos on iwatchthis are), flash cowardly steals the focus disabling our nice keyboard navigation, however I found a way to work around this:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>$('embed').focus(function(){
window.setTimeout(function() {$('#item_1')[0].focus(); }, 500);
})&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Allows us to pilfer back the keyboard focus from the flash widgets shortly after giving it up. Note that in my tests, setting the focus on the document body rather than a link did not work. Also, it seems that this event does not trigger on safari. :/&lt;br />
The good thing about unobtrusive javascript like this tho, is that is downgrades nicely, rather than leaving your visitor with an unusable site. Too bad we can't do much about the flash requirement.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lucasarts Posters.</title><link>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2009-02-09-lucasarts-posters/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author/><guid>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2009-02-09-lucasarts-posters/</guid><description>&lt;p>If you are anything like me, a large part of your misspent youth occured in front of a monitor, playing various games.

It's a pretty nice piece of software, but I couldn't get comfortable with it popping up every time there was a new tweet, as it was a bit too disturbing, and if I turned it off, I forgot to check it out at all.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, lately, I have a much better solution. I already communicate fairly frequently through the venerable Internet Relay Chat protocol (or IRC as most people know it). Thanks to &lt;a href="http://github.com/semifor">semifor&lt;/a>, I now have Twitter as just another channel in my irssi screen:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="thumbnail">&lt;a href="http://skitch.com/marcus/bd81x/default">&lt;img src="http://img.skitch.com/20090202-bkds7empthpnkatjhm4kp9tsns.preview.jpg" alt="Default" />&lt;/a>&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-family: Lucida Grande, Trebuchet, sans-serif, Helvetica, Arial; font-size: 10px; color: #808080">Uploaded with &lt;a href="http://plasq.com/">plasq&lt;/a>'s &lt;a href="http://skitch.com">Skitch&lt;/a>!&lt;/span>&lt;/div>
&lt;p>It runs as a separate process on my irc shell, pretending to be a IRC server. You can run it as a in the background, but for now I'm pretty happy with having it running as a new window in my screen session. Yes, I know that this setup marks me as a unrecoverable geek, but I don't care. It's just so sweet :-) If you don't have root privileges on your shell, you might find &lt;a href="http://search.cpan.org/~apeiron/local-lib-1.003001/lib/local/lib.pm">local::lib&lt;/a> useful to install the required dependencies.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Accessing your Catalyst config from scripts</title><link>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2009-02-01-catalyst_config_from_scripts/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author/><guid>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2009-02-01-catalyst_config_from_scripts/</guid><description>&lt;p>Often, I need to write command line scripts that access my apps' data models. With Catalyst, one way to do this is to to load the actual application, like&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;pre>use iusethis;&lt;/pre>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Then I can access my models like iusethis-&amp;gt;model('DBIC::Person') . However, all I really need is to get the application configuration, and loading a big application is a lot of overhead. Just using Config::Any isn't a good solution tho, since it does not handle _local files properly, among other thing. However, with Config::JFDI there's a better way.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;pre>use Config::JFDI;
my $jfdi = Config::JFDI-&amp;gt;new(name =&amp;gt; "iusethis");
my $config = $jfdi-&amp;gt;get;
my $schema = iusethis::Schema-&amp;gt;connect( @{$config-&amp;gt;{'Model::DBIC'}-&amp;gt;{'connect_info'}})
or die "Failed to connect to database";&lt;/pre>

Turns out that building these with the postmodern object system &lt;a href="http://www.iinteractive.com/moose/">Moose&lt;/a> is  really easy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For those of you not in the know, Moose has the concept of 'Roles', stolen from the Perl 6 project. Roles work kind of like a mix-in that you can add to your class to make it super powerful :)   (For the extra curious, you can read more details about Roles in Perl6 &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl_6#Roles">here&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In order to get my daemon running, I just created a Class like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;pre>package iusethis::Daemon;
use Moose;
with MooseX::Daemonize;
after 'start' =&amp;gt; sub {
my $self=shift;
return unless $self-&amp;gt;is_daemon();
while(1) { $self-&amp;gt;do_menial_tasks(); sleep($until_lunch); }
1;&lt;/pre>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Some notes about the code above&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li> You can see how the role is added using the 'with' keyword.&lt;/li>
&lt;li> In Moose, the 'after' modifier means that our code will hook up to the 'after' method provided by a superclass or Role and run after that method.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The return is because the code forks, to avoid it from running in both the child and the parent.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I also created a simple script to initialize it (&lt;em>scripts/daemon.pl&lt;/em> in my case):&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;pre>#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use strict;
use iusethis::Daemon;
my $daemon = iusethis::Daemon-&amp;gt;new_with_options();
my ($command) = @{$daemon-&amp;gt;extra_argv};
$daemon-&amp;gt;$command if $daemon-&amp;gt;can($command);
warn($daemon-&amp;gt;status_message); exit($daemon-&amp;gt;exit_code);&lt;/pre>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And just like that we have a fully operational persistant server process. You could stuff this thing into /etc/init.d/ if you like, and it will respond to all the expected things like start, stop, restart status. the Daemonize role also supports &lt;a href="http://search.cpan.org/~nuffin/MooseX-Getopt-0.15/lib/MooseX/Getopt.pm">MooseX::GetOpt&lt;/a>. It is enabled by running new_with_options like we did in the class above. This which means your deamon already responds to a common set of command line switches. Run it with -h to see this output:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;pre>usage: daemon.pl [-f] [long options...]
--pidbase
--progname
--stop_timeout
--basedir
--pidfile
-f --foreground&lt;/pre>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>From the 'pidbase' argument, you might have guessed that your fledgling daemon stores the process id in a file just like all the grown up daemons  do, in order to be able to check if it's still alive.  By default, it will store this file in /var/run/, and pidbase is useful for specifying a different path, for instance if you need to run your daemon on a system where you don't have root privileges. the -f flag is also useful for debugging your daemon, as it will keep the process running in the foreground, rather than detaching it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Running in the foreground is nice when you are writing your daemon, but once you have it running, it's nice to have some log output to see what it's been up to lately. I decide to use MooseX::LogDispatch, which is a Moose role which makes it trivial to integrate Log::Dispatch into your daemon. This is what I added to my class to get it running:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;pre>with qw/MooseX::LogDispatch::Levels/;&lt;/pre>
&lt;pre>has log_dispatch_conf =&amp;gt; (
   is =&amp;gt; 'ro',
   isa =&amp;gt; 'HashRef',
   lazy =&amp;gt; 1,
   required =&amp;gt; 1,&lt;/pre>
&lt;pre>    default =&amp;gt; sub {
     my $self = shift;
        {
          class     =&amp;gt; 'Log::Dispatch::File',
          min_level =&amp;gt; 'debug',
mode =&amp;gt; 'append',
          filename =&amp;gt; "/var/log/daemon.log",
            format  =&amp;gt; '[%d] [%p] %m%n',
        }&lt;/pre>
&lt;pre>    },&lt;/pre>
&lt;pre> );&lt;/pre>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>For a more trivial case, you could have just passed in the file name to log to, but I wanted to tweak the log format. (You can read more about the format &lt;a href="http://search.cpan.org/~miyagawa/Log-Dispatch-Config-1.02/lib/Log/Dispatch/Config.pm#GLOBAL_PARAMETERS">here&lt;/a>). This style also allows you to easily adjust the verbosity of your logging. Since this default is lazily evaluated, you could create separate setters for parts of the format and override them on the command line, thanks to MooseX::GetOpt. Once this is set up, all you need to do is use the appropriate level like this&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;pre>$self-&amp;gt;info('Arne sucks at squash');&lt;/pre>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>and an appropriate message is created in your log file:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;pre>[Thu Jan 29 23:50:09 2009] [info] Arne sucks at squash.&lt;/pre>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And that's all you need. I hope this article was useful in showing how you can create your own hellspawn. Enjoy, and use responsibly. :)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ice fishing hole</title><link>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2009-01-30-ice-fishing-hole/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author/><guid>https://marcus.nordaaker.com/post/2009-01-30-ice-fishing-hole/</guid><description>
